ABSTRACT
Bike sharing systems have been in place for several years in many
urban areas as alternative and sustainable means of transporta-
tion. Bicycle usage heavily depends on the available infrastruc-
ture (e.g., protected bike lanes), but other—mutable or immutable—
environmental characteristics of a city can influence the adoption
of the system from its dwellers. Hence, it is important to understand
how these factors influence people’s decisions of whether to use
a bike system or not. In this this paper, we first investigate how
altitude variation influences the usage of the bike sharing system
in Pittsburgh. Using trip data from the system, and controlling for
a number of other potential confounding factors, we formulate the
problem as a classification problem, develop a framework to enable
prediction using Poisson regression, and find that there is a neg-
ative correlation between the altitude difference and the number
of trips between two stations (fewer trips between stations with
larger altitude difference). We further, discuss how the results of our
analysis can be used to inform decision making during the design
and operation of bike sharing systems.

transportation and reducing congestion in cities. However, the
design of the system itself can attract or push away potential riders.
Therefore, it is crucial to obtain actionable insights that can help
design and operate better bike sharing systems.

More specifically, the presence of bicycling infrastructure (e.g.,
protected bike lanes, cycling-friendly street-scape, etc.) is crucial
for riders to use the system [2, 3]. However, other—potentially
immutable—environmental and topographic characteristics of the
city can impact the number of bicyclists. For example, in a sprawling,
city riders will inevitably have to ride longer distances to reach their
destination. Adding on top of that things like weather effects, these
factors can hinder the growth of cycling in a city. Recent studies
have shown that the weather, capacity of bike stations, walkability,
and job accessibility have a significant effect on the bike usage (e.g.,
[4–7]).

In this study, we focus on a particular environmental feature that
can impact ridership, namely, elevation. It makes intuitive sense
that riders might not be willing to ride (steep) uphill. For instance,
Seattle’s bike sharing system had to deal with the problem of ev-
eryone riding downhill, but no one returning bikes uphill [1]. An
analysis of Montreal’s “Bixi” system [6] examined how the elevation
of the station correlates with the usage of the station (in terms of
bike drop-offs), and identified that stations at higher elevations see
lower usage. While this result points to elevation being negatively
correlated with bike usage, these results focus on a specific station.
In contrast, we are interested in pairwise interactions between sta-
tions 𝑖 and 𝑗 , and how the elevation difference between them
relates with the number of trips from 𝑖 to 𝑗 and vice versa. This
allows us to examine the relation between elevation and ridership
in a finer granularity.

More specifically, we build a Poisson regression model for the
number of daily (directional) trips between two stations of the bike
share system in the city of Pittsburgh (“Healthy Ride” - HR for
short) and an interactive analysis among factors such as elevation
difference, distance, and seasonality. One of the benefits of using
data from the system in Pittsburgh is that the city exhibits a fairly
significant elevation variation, as compared to other cities that
have a fairly flat surface such as New York, Chicago, Philadelphia,
Washington D.C., Boston, or Minneapolis. For example, from an
analysis of Chicago’s bikeshare system usage [7], while initially
considered the elevation as an independent variable, the final model
excluded the variable due to small variation across the system’s
station. Figure 1 depicts the HR stations and the relative altitude
map, where we can see there are non-trivial changes across different
areas of the city.

and its relative altitude map.

Our analysis clearly indicates that a higher altitude difference
between the origin and destination stations, is associated with lower
daily trips. The contributions of our work are thus, threefold:

(i) We provide additional evidence to the bikesharing literature
for the negative correlation between altitude and bike sharing usage,
by focusing on altitude differences in pairwise station trips. This is
an important aspect of the scientific process with regards to result
reproducibility and generalizability.

(ii) We build and evaluate predictive models, in contrast to ex-
isting literature in the area that is mainly focused on descriptive
models [6, 7]. This is important, since predictive models can facili-
tate planning operations and examination of “what-if” scenarios.
For example, identifying stations that might be suffering from lack
of trips due to elevation, or pairs of stations that are expected to see
highly asymmetric trips, will help to make decisions on a number
of fronts including the decision of whether to invest on e-bikes, or
informing the design of rebalancing schemes.

(iii) Given the type of model we choose (i.e., Poisson regres-
sion), we examine the probabilistic interpretation of the predictions,
something absent from the existing literature.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we
discuss related to our study literature, while we describe the dataset
and experimental setup used in this study in Section 3. We also
present some descriptive analysis of the bike sharing system trips,
while Section 4 describes our Poisson regression model for the daily
trips between two stations. Finally, Section 5 concludes our work
and future work.

2 RELATEDWORK
A large volume of research on bike sharing systems deals with
the problem of rebalancing. Rebalancing refers to the operation of

transferring bikes from docks with large numbers of bikes, to docks
with fewer bikes available. This is a large operational cost for the
system (approximately 20-25% of the total OPEX) and hence, any
improvement is beneficial. There are several approaches that have
been proposed to study and solve this problem, e.g., [8–10, 17] (with
the list of course being non-exhaustive). More recently, operators
have started moving away from dock-based systems and building
dockless bikesharing that does not require docking stations. These
systems provide more flexibility in terms of returning the bike
to a specific location, but at the same time can create problems
when it comes to finding a bike. Hence, part of the literature on
dockless systems deals with the detection of parking hotspots for
bikes [11, 12].

Closer to our work, a number of studies have explored the con-
nection between the system’s usage and other external factors. For
example, in [5, 9] the authors show that the weather, walkability,
and job accessibility have a significant effect on bike usage. The
authors in [4] compare different regression models for predicting
bike availability at a dock, while the authors in [22] take a cluster-
ing approach in predicting usage. A number of urban environment
features, such as station density, capacity, points of interest, popula-
tion, and housing units are correlated with demand [6, 7, 10, 18, 25].
Some of these studies also examine the elevation of the stations, and
identify a negative correlation with the station’s usage. However,
as previously mentioned, the majority of these studies is focused
on individual stations (rather than interactions between pairwise
stations), and are performed on cities with small elevation variation
to begin. Our work supports prior research by uncovering similar
negative relationships between elevation and ridership, but extends
the literature by focusing on altitude differences between stations
comprising a trip rather than focusing on the absolute altitude of
individual stations.

3 DATA AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
In order to perform our analysis, we collected and analyzed data
from various sources. More specifically, we used the following data:

HR Trips: HR provides information about every trip taken on
the system. Every trip is represented by a tuple with the following
format: <date, start time, end time, origin station ID,
destination station ID>. Our data spans a period of about 4
years, between 05-31-2015 and 06-29-2019, and includes a total of
76 million trips recorded over 112 stations. We also have additional
information for the stations including their location (latitude, longi-
tude) as well as their capacity (number of docks). Table 1 explains
the details.

MapQuest bike paths: In order to calculate the distance be-
tween two bike stations, we do not use the Haversine distance
between the two stations, but we rather take into consideration
the (bike) street network. We use MapQuest’s API and identify the
biking distance between every pair of stations in the system.

Elevation: We get the station’s altitude information from http:
//freemaptools.com by using station’s latitude and longitude infor-
mation.

Weather data: We obtained weather data from https://www.
usclimatedata.com, which provides information about the high and
low temperature recorded and precipitation levels for each day.

Our analysis is split into two parts. We begin by performing a
descriptive analysis of the trips during the span of the four years
that our data covers. This allows us to better understand the patterns
in the trips and choose appropriate variables for the modeling of
trips between two stations. In the second part of our analysis, we
build a Poisson regression model for estimating the number of trips
between specific pairs of stations. For training and evaluating this
model, we only use information from the last year covered from our
data for a variety of reasons. For instance, riding patterns from four
years ago might not be representative of the way HR riders use the
system today (e.g., they might not be as hesitant taking longer trips
today as they were in the beginning of the system). Furthermore,
the system has been updated during these four years (new stations,
stations moved etc.) and hence, we also wanted to focus on a period
of time without significant changes to the network.

3.1 Descriptive Analysis of Daily Bike Trips
We begin by performing some basic, exploratory analysis to under-
stand the trip patterns during the first four years of HR operations
better. In particular, we explore the time-series of daily trips, as well
as trip characteristics like altitude difference and distance covered.

We first examine the basic temporal dynamics of the number
of daily trips observed in the system. Figure 2 (top) depicts the
time-series, where we can see, as one might have expected, that
there is a seasonality with the system’s usage, with more trips
happening during warm weather seasons. The middle part of the
same figure depicts the average altitude difference for all the trips
that happened in a day. As we can see most days exhibit a negative
value, which means that users tend to ride the bikes downhill more
than uphill. It seems that there are some uphill trips in every winter
season, however, it is actually shown due to the average daily trips’
altitude difference over the small number of daily trips. We omit
the uphill trips analysis, but in uphill trips over the year, there are
more uphill trips in the summer season than the winter. The bottom
part of the figure is the average of trip distance covered per day. As
we can see, this average is stable over time, and less than 2 miles,
supporting the idea that biking is a good alternative for short trips
[20].

Central to our study is the relationship between altitude differ-
ences between the origin and destination of a trip and the volume
of such trips. Figure 3 (top) presents the distribution of the station
altitude difference of the trips. As we can see, the majority of trips
happen between stations at about the same altitude, with smaller

distance in miles (bottom) to show the bicycle patterns for

numbers of downhill (left) and uphill (right) trips. This points to the
absence of a linear correlation between the altitude difference and
the number of trips at that altitude difference. As we will elaborate
on in the following sections, discretizing this feature leads to better
performance for our prediction models.

We also examine the distance of trips. Figure 3 (bottom) presents
the distribution of the trip distances, which shows—as one might
have expected—that the majority of the trips (77.9%) are less than 2
miles in distance. It also worth noting that for these distributions
we have removed the trips that start and end at the same station,
since even though the nominal distance is 0, this does not mean
that the trip was of actual length 0.

4 PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR DAILY BIKE
TRIPS

In order to better understand how the various variables relate with
the number of daily trips observed between two stations, we build
an (interpretable) prediction model. We will use a Poisson regres-
sion model, where the dependent variable is the number of daily
trips between a (directional) pair of stations, and we perform feature
selection through a validation set.

4.1 Prediction Features
As our predictors, we use three different types of features:

• Time-related: These are features that capture dependencies
from temporal variables, and in particular, the day of the
week and the season of the year.



Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Injung Kim, Konstantinos Pelechrinis, and Adam J. Lee

Figure 3: The number of bicycle trips of various altitude dif-
ference range in feet (top) and trip distance range in mile
(bottom) in June 2019.

• Weather-related: These are features that capture informa-
tion relevant to the weather conditions during a day. These
include, highest daily temperature, lowest daily temperature,
and precipitation during the day.

• Urban environment-related: These are features that cap-
ture information about the built environment and the urban
landscape. The features we use here are the number of racks
at the origin and destination station, the trip altitude differ-
ence, and the trip distance;

For building our models we rely on data from the last year of
operation of the system. We make this decision to avoid issues with
changing patterns over the 4 years of operations of the system1,
which are further pronounced by changes in the system itself. Fo-
cusing only on the most recent year of operation eliminates these
issues. In particular, we use data from February 1, 2019 to February
28, 2019 (winter data) and May 30, 2019 to June 29, 2019 (summer
data). These two periods correspond to distinct usage patterns for
the system, which should allow us to understand the relationships
between the daily usage and the independent variables better.

For the altitude difference, we will explore two different ap-
proaches; (i) a continuous variable for the difference between the

interesting.

origin and destination station, and (ii) a categorical variable that
indicates the range of the altitude difference. We use the following
ranges: < -200, [-200,-100), [-100,0), [0,100), [100,200), ≥ 200 feet,
marked as -300, -200, -100, 100, 200, 300 in the model. As men-
tioned in the previous section, a range variable might be better
at capturing non-linearities between altitude difference and daily
usage. Part of the feature selection is then related to choosing which
representation is better.

The trip distance is a continuous variable obtained through
MapQuest’s suggested bicycle route (i.e., we do not simply use
the distance as the crow flies). We should note here that the (bike)
distance between station A to B is usually different from the dis-
tance from station B to station A due to the structure of the street
network. Even though based on the results from Fig. 3 there seems
to be a linear relationship between distance and daily usage among
two stations, we examine a binned variable for distance as well. We
use the following ranges: [0,2), [2,4), [4,6), ≥ 6 mile in the feature
selection in Table 3. Our model also includes an interaction term
between the trip distance and the altitude difference variable.

We also include in our features a binary variable that indicates
whether the origin and destination stations are the same. The ratio-
nale behind this is that for trips with the same origin and destination
stations, while the nominal distance and altitude difference is 0,
these are plasmatic differences (e.g., the actual distance covered
from the rider is certainly > 0). Inclusion of this variable or not will
again be driven from the feature selection. Table 2 summarizes the
features considered when building our model.

4.2 Poisson Regression
Our goal is to model the number of daily trips 𝑌𝑖 𝑗 from station 𝑖 to
station 𝑗 . Given that our dependent variable 𝑌𝑖 𝑗 is a non-negative
integer, a linear regression is not an appropriate model. Hence,
we choose to use a Poisson regression, where essentially the data
is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, i.e., 𝑌𝑖 𝑗∼𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠 (_𝑌 ). A
Poisson regression essentially models the average rate of the depen-
dent variable through a linear combination of a set of independent
variables X as:

_𝑌 = 𝑒
𝛼+(b·X) (1)

The parameters 𝛼 and b are obtained through maximum likeli-
hood estimation and we can thus, estimate the distribution for 𝑌𝑖 𝑗
as:

𝑝 (𝑌𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑘 |X, b, 𝛼) =
𝑒𝑘 · (𝛼+(b·X))

𝑘!
· 𝑒−𝑒

4.3 Feature Selection
In order to perform feature selection, we randomly split the dataset
into three sets: train, validation, and test, at a 7:2:1 ratio.

We examine ten different models, and Table 3 presents the fea-
tures used in each model. Note that the second and third features
do not correspond to a specific feature but rather on the way the
model is trained. In particular, “separate season” corresponds to
two different models being trained, one on summer data only and
one on winter data only. A “combined season” model uses all the
data for training, and includes a categorical variable to indicate
the season. For the cases where separate models for summer and
winter are trained, we calculate the average of root mean square
error (RMSE) weighted by the number of data points from the cor-
responding season. This setting ensures that all models are trained,
validated and tested on exactly the same data.

of altitude difference in summer (top) and winter (bottom).
𝑎 + 𝑏𝑥 where x is the distance, a and b are given coefficients

Based on the results on the validation set, FS 9 exhibits the lowest
RMSE, and hence, our analysis focuses on this model. FS 9 uses a
range variable for altitude (as opposed to a continuous variable)
and trains separate models for summer and winter. Table 4 shows
the models obtained for the two seasons.

of trips.

4.4 Results
Table 4 presents the results from our selected model. As we can
see the majority of the features have the same direction for their
effect (i.e., positive or negative) in both the summer and winter
seasons. For example, precipitation is negatively correlated with

usage in both seasons. However, the effect size is different. Further-
more, large distances between origin and destination stations are
associated with smaller number of trips.

Given the interaction term between distance and altitude differ-
ence, in order to interpret the relationship between distance and

daily usage we need to know the altitude difference as well. For ex-
ample, if altitude difference is between -200 and -100 feet, then the
total coefficient for distance is -0.39-0.23=-0.62. However, for most
differences in altitude the corresponding total coefficient are going
to be positive. Similar interpretation should be made for the alti-
tude difference effect. From the “pure” coefficients for the altitude
difference we can see that as the altitude difference approaches 0
we have the largest positive impact on daily usage, while the effect
reduces as we move to downhill or uphill trips. Furthermore, uphill
trips do not only have lower coefficients, but this is also negative
(similar to the shape of the distribution at Figure 3). Again, in or-
der to quantify the total effect of the altitude difference we would
need to know the distance of the trip. For example, for an average
distance trip of 1.8 miles, the total coefficient/effect for the altitude
difference would be: 0.89+1.8 · (−0.23) = 0.47 for trips with altitude
difference between -200 and -100 feet, 1.21 + 1.8 · (−0.16) = 0.92
for trips with altitude difference between -100 and 0 feet, and so
on. Figure. 4 shows the total coefficient/effect for each range of
altitude difference in summer and winter, and the total coefficient
is essentially a line 𝑎 +𝑏𝑥 , where 𝑥 is the distance, 𝑎 and 𝑏 are given
coefficients.

As mentioned earlier, we evaluate the selected model using the
RMSE achieved over the test set, which is approximately 0.16. Fig-
ure 5 depicts the performance on each data point on the test set.
In particular, every point on the x-axis corresponds to a test point,
with the blue “bar” corresponding to the actual number of trips
observed for this data point, and the red “bar” representing the
predicted value from our model. As we can see, during the summer
the daily number of trips is larger on average as compared to the
winter and so are the predictions from our model. Furthermore,
when comparing the performance of our model during the different
seasons, we find that the RMSE of the model on the winter test
set is smaller (0.0881), as compared to that of the summer (0.2327).
This can be attributed to the fact that there is less variability for
the trips over the winter, since the majority of the winter trips will
not be recreational (which are typically less predictable).

One benefit of our analysis is the ability to obtain an actual
distribution for the predicted number of trips between two stations.
In particular, if our prediction for the number of trips is𝑦𝑛 , then the
actual distribution for the number of trips is a Poisson distribution
with mean _ = 𝑦𝑛 . Hence, one can also examine the probability
𝜋𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 assigned by ourmodel to the value of the actual trips observed.
For example, if our prediction is 2.4 trips, while the observed number
of trips was 4, then our prediction provided a 0.125 probability to
this outcome (𝑝𝑚𝑓𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛 (𝑘 = 4, _ = 2.4) = 0.125). While this might
seem low, the same prediction provides its maximum probability to
the value of 2, which is equal to 0.26 - i.e., max𝑘 𝑝𝑚𝑓𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛 (𝑘, _ =
2.4) = 0.26, for 𝑘 = 2.

4.5 Discussion and Limitations
Discussion. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the

first to consider the relative altitude difference between the ori-
gin and destination stations in bike sharing systems as a factor
when predicting trip likelihood. As shown in Section 4.4, this was
a significant factor in predicting trips between stations. Prior work

considering only absolute station altitude could easily overcompen-
sate for the effect of altitude when looking at trips in areas of the
city with little altitude variation, whereas our work accounts for
this explicitly. In terms of future work, it would be interesting to
investigate whether health-related ‘microtasks’ could exploit this
negative correlation to help with bicycle rebalancing in small local
areas. Phrased another way, can individuals be incentivized to take
short breaks (e.g., 15 minutes) to ride a bike uphill from one station
to another nearby (but higher altitude) station and walk back to
their home or workplace? This would have positive health bene-
fits for individuals, positive benefits for the bike sharing system
in terms of bike availability, and is highly applicable in cities like
Pittsburgh with high variance in altitude over small distances.

Our daily bike usage predictive models are built and evaluated by
narrowing down the features and analyzing in an interactive way
among the features. Unlike other descriptive model works [6, 7],
our predictive models can facilitate planning operations and ex-
amination. Not just improving urban bike sharing system, but also
resolving one transportation problem with other transportation
methods is also possible through our prediction. For example, city
planner can build more bus lines at uphill, reduce the lines at the
short distance downhill, and expand the bike station docks at down-
hill stations, then it can ultimately reduce the bicycle rebalancing
cost.

Limitations. Given thatwe are interested in the elevation changes
during a trip, it would be ideal if we were able to identify all sources
of altitude variation along the trip, and not simply the altitude dif-
ference between the origin and destination stations. Similarly, the
slope of these changes would be an interesting feature to consider
in an analysis such as ours. Unfortunately, this is not possible for
two reasons. First, we do not know which path the riders followed
between the origin and destination stations. Further, even if we
assume that riders took the shortest bike route between the two
stations, the services that we have used to identify bike paths (e.g.,
MapQuest) do not provide path altitude information. While Google
Maps visualizes altitude variation along a route, the available APIs
do not provide access to this data.

In addition, our analysis considered only one city. It would be
interesting to carry out our analysis using bike sharing data from
other hilly cities (e.g., San Francisco) as well as flatter cities (e.g.,
Chicago). Furthermore, extending our analysis with a wider fea-
ture set inclusive of factors such as job density, population, nearby
bus stations, likely improves the performance of our models, as
well as allows us to more fully understand the importance of rel-
ative altitude as compared to, say, access to other forms of public
transportation.

5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explore the daily usage in terms of number of trips
between a (directional) pair of stations for the bike share system in
Pittsburgh. We use a Poisson regression model and perform feature
selection through a validation set. Our results indicate that the
altitude difference, station distance, as well as, weather features
impact the usage of the system. This adds evidence to an existing
body of literature on the impact of elevation on bike usage.

As part of our future work, we intend to explore several direc-
tions in improving the predictive power of our model. For example,
we have used Poisson model, but a negative binomial might be a
better fit for the trip data. Furthermore, regularization can further
help improve the predictive performance. We also plan to extend
our study to cover other cities (both in the US and outside the states)
in order to make direct comparisons and obtain more generalizable
conclusions.
