A framework is proposed in which certain well-known concepts of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics can be used and
applied to characterize structural systems of interconnected Timoshenko beam elements. We first make the assimilation to a
network of nodes linked by potential energy functions that are derived from the stiffness properties of the beams. Then we define
a series of thermodynamic quantities inherent to a given structure (i.e., internal energy, heat, pressure, temperature, entropy, and
kinetic energy). With the exception of entropy, all of them have the dimensions of energy. In order to test this new framework, a
series of experiments was performed on four structural specimens within the elastic regime. Their configurations were taken from
the seismic regulations known as Eurocode 8 in order to have a better based reference for our comparisons. The results are then
explained within this new framework. Very interesting correlations have been found between the parameters given in the code and
our concepts.

1. Introduction

1.1. Aim of the Research. The present paper explores the
viability of employing concepts of statistical mechanics and
thermodynamics as tools for the analysis of conventional
structures.

Energy principles have been intensively employed in
structural mechanics for several decades, either to obtain
governing equations by means of variational methods or to
justify different approximation methods (may references [1,
2] serve as examples). However, in practice, the goal of these
methods is commonly limited to retrieve strains, stresses, and
displacements. Such an approach omits the very important
fact that, by treating problems of elastomechanics under the
perspective of energy transfer and energy balance instead
of only balance of forces, much valuable hindsight can be
obtained regarding a structural system.

Very interesting and promising advances have already
been made thanks to the observation of the behaviour in the
energy domain in the areas of fluid-structure interaction [3],
structural impact [4], or structural dynamics [5], to name a
few.

In our case, the particular field of application will be
earthquake engineering. Modelling seismic structural respo-
nse as an energetic exchange process between the soil and
the structural system has attracted the interest of many
researchers in the past decades ([6–8]).

In this work a series of structural configurations will be
presented and compared based on quantities such as total
work, internal energy, temperature, heat, kinetic energy, and
entropy.

The conventional scope of such quantities is tied to the
study of systems with a large number of nanoscopic or
microscopic particles.

The information they provide about a system, however,
can also be useful in the characterization of different macro-
scopic structural systems with a relatively small number of
nodes. To such effect, however, some work needs to be done
in order to adapt the existing tools for analysis.

We have resourced to a general purpose finite element
application andmodified it in order to retrieve the aforemen-
tioned quantities. We have defined a series of nodes where
the distributed strains and stresses given by the constitutive

model have been lumped. Our contribution allows treating
models of beams as models of particles and applying the
analytical techniques of statistical mechanics.

1.2. Another Field of Application of Statistical Mechanics.
Statistical mechanics are widely used for the simulation
and definition of material properties in many scientific
disciplines.

In statistical mechanics, the elementary particles are
molecules or atoms which are represented as point masses
that are connected to one another by means of potential
functions.These functions, together with velocities, allow for
the computation of potential and kinetic energy states from
which statistical data about the particles can be obtained and
then used to characterize macroscopic behaviours.

Current research in the characterization of nanoscale
structures ranges from the description of the properties
of nanotubes of different elements (carbon, boron nitride,
silicon,. . .) to that of polymer composites. References [9–11]
show how structural, elastic, and thermodynamic parameters
can be defined for the study of the global behaviour of
different materials from their atomic scale.

On the other side, in engineering practice, the most
extended discretization methods are those which simu-
late matter by replacing it with pieces that interpolate
the expected material behaviour (deformation, heat, etc.)
between a series of nodes. Such are the techniques of finite
elements, finite differences, or boundary elements, among
many others.

These conventional continuum methods, however, are
not applicable to nanoscale components because macroscale
behaviour is incorporated in the constitutivemodels of solids,
generally based on empirical results [12].

In their standard implementations, these methods pro-
vide the analyst information regarding the strain or stress
states of links or “elements” between nodes (i.e., rods, beams,
tetrahedra, etc.) but give no results regarding what happens
in the actual nodes.

The main purpose of this paper is to provide means of
translating those techniques employed in the representation
of atomistic systems and make them available also for
macroscopic systems.

1.3.TheThermodynamic Properties of Structural Systems. The
branch of statistical mechanics which treats and extends
classical thermodynamics is known as statistical thermo-
dynamics. This discipline seeks to relate the microscopic
properties of individual particles to the bulk properties of the
sample which contains them.

In analogy, if a structural system is treated as a set
of interconnected nodes, the global characteristics of its
behaviour can be described by using probabilistic and statis-
tical techniques.

By defining thermodynamic parameters for a structural
system and establishing relationships between them, it is
possible to expand our understanding of it in a more global
manner.

Instead of just monitoring the internal tension distribu-
tions of particular beam elements or the displacements of a
defined node, one can achieve a general view about how a
whole system responds to a set of loads by computing, for
example, its degree of “structural heat,” which summarizes in
a single parameter both the internal stress distribution and
the amount of displacement. These parameters are extremely
valuable for the proper design of structures of any kind.

For the sake of simplicity, this study has been limited
to Timoshenko beam configurations in two-dimensional
frame-like structures. However, this scheme is a general one
and can be applied to any kind of structure and to other types
of discretization other than beam type finite elements.

Using statistical relations between the nodes, in the
present paper the following thermodynamic variables have
been computed:

(i) the number of nodes, 𝑁,
(ii) the change of internal energy, 𝑑𝑈,
(iii) the change of internal strain energy, 𝛿𝑊,
(iv) the added heat, 𝛿𝑄,
(v) the change in entropy, 𝑑𝑆,
(vi) the temperature, 𝑇,
(vii) the quasistatic kinetic energy, KEqs.

The energy related quantities listed above are relatively
straightforward to obtain, as will be shown in the following
section.

For the definition of the entropy, due to the relatively
small number of involved particles, 𝑁, we have had to
resource to nonasymptotic thermodynamic ensembles. In
this case, Boltzmann’s equation for the definition of probabil-
ities does not apply, so for the calculation of the probabilities
of the nodal energetic states it was necessary to make use of a
frequency based model adapted from references [13, 14].

1.4. Numerical Examples. The behaviour of four different
structures with the same number of nodes but different topo-
logical complexity was investigated under a simple lateral
load. Their description was based on widely used seismic
regulations.

In the recent past, the research community of seismic
structural analysis has made particular emphasis on the
energetic aspects of the dynamic behaviour of the structures,
so that currently the energy absorption capacity of a building
is starting to be considered a good measure of its seismic
performance.

For practical reasons, these behaviours are often synthe-
sized in the form of coefficients that, conveniently applied,
serve as tools for the analysts and designers. Many of
these coefficients, however, are of empiric origin and their
theoretical fundament is not always deeply explained.

As an example of the versatility of our methodology,
we studied one of these parameters, provided by a broadly
used design standard (Eurocode 8, [15]), as applied to our
structural systems of choice. This parameter is known as the
behaviour factor, 𝑞, and synthesizes the tendency of a given
structural configuration to yield under the applied loads.



Advances in Mechanical Engineering 3

The space of possible states of each structure was explored
by means of random iterations over the magnitude of the
applied load. These variations allow for the observation of
particular tendencies and correlations between the above-
listed variables. The range of calculated values of these
variables (KE, 𝛿𝑊, 𝛿𝑄, 𝑑𝑆, 𝑇) is shown as a function of the
applied load, so that an outline of their response can be
observed.

2. Elements of Statistical Mechanics for
Structural Systems

In this section a set of quantities involving energetic terms
will be presented for their subsequent application in the
numerical examples.

In common structural engineering practice, the emphasis
of the analysis is mainly done in stresses, strains, and
displacements. This is due to the fact that the purpose of
such analysis is to design, eventually, structural elements such
as beams and columns. The global energetic behaviour of
the structural system has been considered unimportant until
recently and the acquisition of such data has not received the
deserved attention.

What is presented here is a methodology to calculate
elementary energy-related terms from a general-purpose
finite element application whose relationship to the applied
force can be later studied under the perspective of a thermo-
dynamic exchange process.

Themain hurdle is to associate the macroscopic constitu-
tive models of beams to node-clustered points of energy. In
particular, this is necessary to calculate the global values of
internal work and entropy.

In general, the techniques employed in modelling micro-
scopic structures explicitly set up molecular networks as
atoms bonded by potentials. This facilitates the implementa-
tion of simulators of molecular mechanics. Some efforts have
been done in associating those potentials with finite element
method’s elements ([12, 16]) and have successfully proven that
the change of scale is possible.

The advantage of investigating energetic relationships
between particles instead of particular changes in the bonds
between them is mainly that of global perspective.

By treating structural systems with the techniques of
statistical mechanics, we are making possible the identifica-
tion of constants and patterns that would otherwise remain
unappreciated.

Under the scope of thermodynamics, global continuous
quantities and their behaviour are studied, providing a higher
level of understanding when applied to macroscale systems
such as built structures.

The first law of thermodynamics is an equation of change:

𝑑𝑈 = 𝛿𝑄 − 𝛿𝑊, (1)

where 𝑑𝑈 is the change in the internal energy of the system,
𝛿𝑄 is the heat added to the system, and 𝛿𝑊 is the work
performed on the system.

Within the proposed framework of this paper, the systems
which are under study consist of sets of interconnected

Timoshenko beams under the effect of static loads. By means
of a general purpose finite element application, the linear
equations which yield the displacement vector are solved,
and the corresponding internal stresses and tensions are
obtained.

2.1. Internal Energy, 𝑑𝑈. As the presentedmechanical system
is considered to be thermodynamically closed, the value of
the change in the internal energy is computed from the actual
value of external work. Given the solution of the displace-
ment vector and the applied force vector, it can be stated
that

𝑑𝑈 =

1

2

{𝐹}

𝑇
⋅ {𝑥} , (2)

where {𝐹} is the vector of the applied forces and {𝑥} represents
the displacement of each degree of freedom. This value is
equivalent to the expression involving the stiffness matrix
[𝐾𝑔]:

𝑑𝑈 =

1

2

{𝑥}

𝑇
⋅ [𝐾𝑔] ⋅ {𝑥} , (3)

as the displacement {𝑥} is the solution of the system of
equations defined by [𝐾𝑔] and the vector {𝐹}.

2.2. Internal Work, 𝛿𝑊. In classical thermodynamics, this
internal form of energy is associatedwith themechanical part
of the changing process. For the particular case of ideal gases
or any nonviscous fluid, this term of the equation of change
is generally assumed to be

𝛿𝑊 = −𝑝𝑑𝑉, (4)

where 𝑝 is the pressure applied to the system and 𝑑𝑉 is
the change in volume. For an elastic medium, however,
this mechanical energy term must consider the work done
by the internal stresses and the strains [17]. This means
that our definition of the work performed on the system
is

𝛿𝑊 = −

1

2

∫

𝑉

𝜎 ⋅ 𝜀𝑑𝑉, (5)

where 𝜎 represents the internal stresses and 𝜀 represents
the internal strains, integrated over the whole volume of
the structure, 𝑉. The direction of this work is opposed
to that of the total internal energy, hence the negative
sign.

a Beam. 𝐸 and 𝐺 are material properties, that is, Young’s
modulus and the shear modulus or modulus of rigidity,
respectively. 𝐴, 𝐼, and 𝐽 are the geometric constants of the
beam element’s section: its area, moment of inertia, and
moment of torsion. The internal strains are defined in terms

In order to assimilate the above concepts to a structural
system, where several elements are combined and attached in
𝑁 nodes, it is proposed that a straightforward connection be
made between the nodes, acting as atoms or molecules, and
the beam elements, taken as bonds between them.

The formulae given in (6), either as a function of the
internal beam strains or as a function of the internal stresses,
can be used to such effect.

Internal stresses (axial 𝐴, bending 𝑀, shear 𝑆, and tor-
sional 𝑇) are commonly available from any general purpose
finite element Method software. The stress-based integrals of
(6) can then be used in discrete form as a sum through the
defined integration stations of each element.

Each beam is subdivided in stations for which the stress
data can be retrieved, so that the particular nodal internal
energy may be approximated by summing the contributions
of half of each connected beam.

By summing the energetic state of all the nodes, the total
internal energy of the system is then computed as

are the respective internal

energies of each beam as calculated from (6).

2.3. Added Heat, 𝛿𝑄. The heat added to a system is directly
related to the amount of movement of its particles, which
are, in our case, represented by the nodes of the investigated
structure. Thus it involves the entropy gained by the system
in the process and its temperature:

𝛿𝑄 = 𝑇 ⋅ 𝑑𝑆. (8)

When dealing with the atomic level, solids are treated as
regular lattices of atoms, tied together with bonds which
cannot vibrate independently. Among many others, this
was one of the contributions of Einstein to our current
understanding of matter and, probably, the seed of statistical
mechanics [18].

In order to account for the energy associated with the
movement of these atoms, the vibrations take the form of

collective modes which propagate through thematerial. Such
propagating lattice vibrations can be considered to be sound
waves, whose speed is the speed of sound in the material.The
average of this energy is characterized by the temperature, 𝑇,
while 𝑑𝑆, the increase in entropy, parameterizes the “quality”
of such energy, that is, its degree of order.

For our purposes, however, it is not straightforward to
make a definition of “structural temperature” and in order
to compute the value of the heat change we simply proceed
to substitute the values of 𝑑𝑈 and 𝛿𝑊 previously obtained
through (2) and (7), yielding

𝛿𝑄 = 𝑑𝑈 + 𝛿𝑊. (9)

2.4. Entropy Change, 𝑑𝑆. Another term involved in (8) is
entropy, 𝑆. Traditionally, it is considered to be an intrinsic
property of a system. However, recently some authors have
claimed that it could be more correct to understand it as a
property of the description of the system [6]. From this point of
view, and taking into account the many available definitions
of entropy, we decided in favour of an interpretation which is
closer to the approach provided in thermodynamics.

In order to compute the increase of entropy 𝑑𝑆 a
frequency-based approach was adopted for the computation
of the probabilities [19–21].

First, each of the 𝑁 nodal internal energies 𝛿𝑊
𝑖
was

calculated for each node, as defined previously in the point
B.

Then a constant sized bin histogram representing the
nodal energetic states could be created for each model out of
a number of simulations sufficiently large. As an illustrative
example, Figure 2 shows the histogram corresponding to
model A, which is further described in the next section of
this paper.

The discrete probability of a node to be in an energy state
𝛿𝑊

𝑖
is then defined as

𝑝

𝑖discr =
freq (𝛿𝑊

𝑖
)

𝑁tot
, (10)

where 𝑁tot is the number of nodes of the structure, 𝑁,
multiplied by the number of simulations (for our example
we used 1000). In statistical terms, this value of probability
is just the frequency with which the value 𝛿𝑊

𝑖
is found in a

population of𝑁tot nodal energy states, normalized to the total
number of nodal energy states of the model.

Already in the case of 1000 simulations it is possible to
observe the long-tail behaviour of the distribution (Figure 1).
In our case this distribution is best approximated by the well-
known Pareto law. In Figure 3 the probability mass functions
for the same example model A has been plotted with a
superimposed Pareto law as explained in [21], which can be
described by the equation:

freq (𝑟) =
ln (1 + (1/𝑟))
ln (𝑅 + 1)

, (11)

where 𝑟 is an integer value between 1 and 𝑅, the total number
of bins between the largest and the smallest value of nodal

frequency it is now possible to recalculate, for each nodal
state, the corresponding continuous probabilistic value as

𝑝

𝑖cont =

𝑁

.
(12)

The probabilities can then be obtained for each node after
each simulation iteration.

Using the node’s energy state from the density function of
the fitted Pareto distribution, it was then possible to retrieve
the continuous value of probability, 𝑝

𝑖cont.
The increase in entropy was then computed as the sum

of all the particular approximated probabilities of each node,
times their logarithm:

𝑖=0

Figure 3: Underlying nodal distribution for all specimens. Our
experiment will evidence how the different topological relationships
between the nodes give place to different entropic and energetic
behaviours.

The value of the entropy given in (13) provides us with
a measure of how much a particular configuration of a
structural system under applied forces affects its capacity to
absorb heat. It increases linearly with the number of nodes of
the structure, 𝑁, and is related to the existence of disparities
in the distribution of the internal strain energy.

The omission of Boltzmann’s constant, 𝑘
𝑏
, in the def-

inition of (13) must be noted here. This happens as a
consequence of the low number of entities involved, far
below Avogadro’s number, which makes the bulk scaling
unnecessary. This also renders our definition of entropy
dimensionless, as it is only a function of probabilities.

2.5. Temperature, 𝑇. The remaining quantity involved in the
description of a system’s internal agitation is the temperature.
This quantity must not be mistaken with that of ambient
temperature or atmospheric temperature but be understood
as a reference for the average energy gained by the nodes
when subject to displacement.

In our case this value is not available as given data, and
its definition for structural systems is not straightforward.
However, it is easy to calculate from the definition given by
classical thermodynamics in (8):

𝑇 =

𝛿𝑄

𝑑𝑆

.
(14)

This value of temperature can be understood as a measure of
the tendency of a structural system to dissipate applied energy
by displacement instead of concentrating it internally.

Some authors define it as a measure of the quality of
a state of a system [22], while others refer to it as the
degree of “hotness” of a system [23]. In our case, higher
values of temperature imply global deterioration of the static
behaviour, whereas at lower values the system shows a higher
degree of stiffness.

As follows from (14) and the fact that our definition of
entropy has no dimensions, its units are those of energy.



6 Advances in Mechanical Engineering

2.6. The Kinetic Energy of a System, 𝐾𝐸. Our simulations
represent quasistatic processes, where changes are homoge-
neous throughout the system and slow enough as tomaintain
a constant state of equilibrium. In these terms, a kinetic
definition makes little sense because the process is more
commonly defined as simply static.

However, the contribution of the mass of the system to its
displaced configuration cannot be neglected.

In general, from the available data of a static simulation,
using a general-purpose finite element application, it is pos-
sible to derive the following expression for the computation
of the kinetic term:

KE =
1

2

{�̇�}

𝑇
⋅ [𝑀] ⋅ {�̇�} ,

(15)

where the superscript dot denotes derivative with respect to
time and the mass matrix [𝑀] is assembled by simple
addition of each beam elements’ particular masses to their
concurrent nodes (i.e., lumped mass matrix).

In our case, however, this expression presents two prob-
lems.

(1) We are lacking an objective definition of time.
(2) The quasistatic approach implies that the inertia

forces and kinetic energy, respectively, are neglected
in the equations of motion and energy balance.

Conveniently, however, a unitary time step can be defined for
every iteration of our experiments, yielding

{�̇�} =

𝑑 {𝑥 (𝑡)}

𝑑𝑡

=

𝑑 {𝑥 (𝑡)}

1

= {𝑥} ,
(16)

which means that we can dismiss the time dependency of the
structural response and obtain information purely related to
the inertia of the system and its resistance to change in its
motion. With this simplification it is now possible to rewrite
the quasistatic equation for kinetic energy:

KEqs =
1

{𝑥}

𝑇
⋅ [𝑀] ⋅ {𝑥} .

(17)

3. A Practical Example: Numerical
Experiments with Conventional Structures

Since the mid-70s many researchers have claimed that input
energy can be a good parameter to be considered in seismic
design of buildings, given the shortcomings experienced by
strength-based seismic design codes [7, 8].

The amount of energy absorbed by a structure during
a seismic event, strong enough to induce a certain amount
of nonlinear deformation, has been accepted by many rese-
archers as a potentially useful seismic performance indicator
[24].

This indicator, however, is difficult to measure in a global
sense with the current analysis tools given the methodologi-
cal limitations mentioned in the introduction of the previous
section.

Within our proposed frame, however, a global set of
energy-based parameters is straightforward and clear.Wewill
present their relationship to the applied force in a series of
quasistatic simulations.

3.1. Description of the Models. Four different specimens were
tested, as well as the thermodynamic quantities mentioned
earlier computed using a general purpose finite element
application. Their configurations were adopted from the
seismic regulation Eurocode 8, where a behaviour factor 𝑞 is
defined for several different kinds of structural arrangements.
This behaviour factor serves, in a simplified calculation of
the nonlinear dynamic response of a structure, to reduce the
value of the applied design forces.

Higher values of this factor imply the assumption of better
behaviour in the event of plastification of the elements. In
other words, the behaviour factor accounts for the ability of
the structure to dissipate energy by nonlinear behaviour of
rotational springs.

As these are illustrative examples, we have avoided
excessive complexity as much as possible. The specimens
were treated as 2D models and time-history analysis was not
performed. Geometrical and material nonlinear behaviours,
however, had to be observed for the sake of completeness.

In Figure 3 the underlying nodal distribution is shown for
all four specimens. It can be seen how, sharing all the nodes
identical geometric disposition, the particular characteristics
of the structural system reside mainly in the topological
relationships.

For the modelization of the Timoshenko beam elements,
a type of profile common in engineering practice was chosen,
with values similar to those corresponding to a 150 × 150 ×
10mm hollow extruded steel bar. The material and section
properties are shown in Table 1.

The geometric configuration of each model is displayed
in Figure 4, and the nonlinear characteristics of the material
employed are depicted in Figure 5.

Some characteristic properties of the samplemodels, such
as volume, mass, and moments of inertia are provided in
Table 2. Mass was obtained as the product of the volume and
the material density (structural steel).

The total volume of each specimen was computed by
multiplying the section area given in Table 1 by the added
length of every beam.

the ratio between 𝑑𝑊 and 𝑑𝑈 is a constant while no plastic
hinges are formed.

The higher flexibility of model A is evidenced by its
significant larger span of dissipated energy in comparison
with the other three models, which represent a small dot at
the beginning of the curve.

Moreover, model A is the only one that actually develops
plastic hinges under the same range of applied loads. It is very
interesting to observe how the evolution of the global ratio
𝑑𝑈/𝑑𝑊 evolves in a quadratic fashion, while for the other
models it remains within a linear relationship.

Once plastic hinges begin to appear (around the value of
2000 kNcm), the total energy 𝑑𝑈 increases faster than the
change of the internal work, evidencing no further storage
of strain energy in the nodes and yet more in the form of
displacement.

The last segment of the curve presents a discontinuity
originated in the loss of convergence of the nonlinear com-
putations.

The ratio between these two quantities permits compar-
ing how much energy a particular structural configuration is
able to absorb with respect to the others. It also allows for
the prediction of the behaviour within the elastic range, as it
proves that a linear relationship exists between them.

To help understanding the 𝑑𝑈 quantity, Figure 7 illus-
trates how the increment of total internal energy of a
structural system is only inversely proportional to its stiffness
while quadratically dependent on the applied force.

In consequence, flexible structures are capable of dis-
sipating a large amount of applied energy in the form of
displacements.

If such systems are only slightlymore rigid, however, their
dissipative capacity is rapidly reduced and must resource to
othermechanisms in order to balance the energies.How these

mechanisms basically consist on reducing their entropy will
be seen.

Figure 8 depicts the quadratic relationship between the
applied load and the total internal energy. Models A and
D, with identical values of the coefficient 𝑞, have very
different responses to the applied force, whereas B and C,
which are distant in the value of this parameter, behave very
similarly. There is, however, an apparent correlation between
the magnitude of the 𝑞 factor and the slope of the curve: the
higher the factor, the higher the slope.

Figure 9 shows variation of entropy with respect to
applied force. The curves present a very interesting parallel
decreasing behaviour, indicating that a rise in the energy in
the system leads to a reduction of its entropy.

Figure 9: Variation of entropy with respect to the force applied to
the system. A higher force results in a higher total energy 𝑑𝑈. As 𝑑𝑈
increases, the individual nodal energies reach higher values, whose
probabilities are lower according to the Pareto law. This leads to
lower values of the entropy.

Models A and D present very little change in their
entropic behaviour, whereas B and C remain stationary until
a certain level of force is applied.

This can be explainedmathematically, as for lower energy
states of the system, the individual probabilities of each nodal
state are higher, making the distributionmore homogeneous,
which leads to a higher entropy.

When the available energy is higher for all the nodes,
these must also increase their energetic state and the differ-
ence in probabilities from one another increases. This causes
the entropy to decrease as, from the definition given in (13),
the maximum value of the entropy is achieved for a system in
which all the nodes share the available energy equally and are
equally probable.

This maximum can be observed in the upper section of
each curve, where flat behaviour is present.

In a case of much disparity and the predominance of high
values of nodal energy, the entropy tends to a minimum as
the majority of the nodes have high values of energy whose
probability is lower according to the Pareto law.

Structurally, it provides information about the degree of
evenness in the distribution of the internal work, which is
directly related to the internal distribution of the tensions. A
higher value of entropy means a lower likelihood of concen-
trated tensions. Hence, models B and C can be considered as
structureswith a good redistribution of internal strain energy,
whereas models A and D are poor in this aspect.

In relation to the behaviour factor 𝑞, this makes sense as
the purpose of such coefficient is to penalize the structures
that show no plastic deformation of its members. Hence,
models A and D, with lower entropies, are more likely
to concentrate tensions (i.e., nodal energies) that might
eventually lead to the appearance of hinges.

To better understand our definition of entropy, Figure 10
illustrates the evolution of 𝑑𝑆 for the different possible values

Higher values of probability do not necessarily imply higher entropy.
In fact, the highest entropy of the system would be achieved if the
probabilities of all the nodes were in the vicinity of 37%.

of 𝑝
𝑖cont. The highest possible value that a node could, in any

case, contribute is that of 0,367 units of entropy and that
would be so if the value of its probability were 37% regardless
of the structural configuration the node would be immersed
in.

For a structural system, this means that unevenly dis-
tributed stresses lead to concentrate high values of strain
energy at certain points and low in others. According to the
Pareto law of Figure 2 this results in a lower value of the
global entropy because both high and low nodal energies
have, respectively, very low and very high probabilities.

The lowest bottom for the particular configuration of
nodes of this study, as represented in Figure 3, corresponds to
the lines of models A and D, whose entropy is lowest. These
correspond also to the highest values of the behaviour factor
𝑞.

The chart shown in Figure 11 is also interesting as it
summarizes much of the information provided by both
Figures 8 and 9.

The value of 𝛿𝑄 expresses how close the values of the
internal elastic energy 𝑑𝑊 and the total energy 𝑑𝑈 are, in
other words, how far from unity the ratio 𝛾 = 𝛿𝑊/𝑑𝑈 is.

As it can be appreciated in Figure 8, while in the elastic
regime 𝛾 is constant regardless of the amount of total energy.
For model A, 𝑑𝑈 is 25% larger than 𝛿𝑊, whereas for the rest
of models the ratio remains very close to 1.

When plastic dissipative processes are studied, 𝑑𝑈 and
𝛿𝑊 depend on each other to a lesser extent. As plastic joints
begin to appear, the structure loses stiffness and the possible
displacements become larger, so that the value of the kinetic
energy is increased.

As a consequence of this, the temperature of the system
must also increase. Whereas the entropy of the system
remains more or less constant under a constant value of
the applied force, the temperature must increase in order to
compensate for the larger amount of heat energy available to
the system. This principle is the same that explains rubber
elasticity.

Keeping in mind the fact that all four models have the
same number of nodes, whose topological relationships are

dictated by the interconnecting beams, a larger number of
connected nodes mean also a more even redistribution of the
internal work among them. This explains the difference not
only in the response of their internal work but also in the
entropy between the models.

Themodels whose nodes havemore connections are both
B and C. In the case of model A, any node has at most three
beams, whereas for model D the maximum is four.

In the chart of Figure 12 the values of quasistatic kinetic
energy are presented against the applied force.

The kind of information that can be extracted from the
values of KEsq is related to whether a structure’s behaviour
is dominated by the mass of its elements or by their beams’
distribution.

In Figure 13 the quasistatic kinetic energy of a single-
beam structure is presented against its mass to illustrate their
relationship.

Figure 12: Variation of quasistatic kinetic energy with respect to
force applied on the system.The relationship between kinetic energy
and applied force is quadratic. Flexible structures present narrow
parabolas.

Aswhat occurred in Figure 7with the stiffness𝐾𝑔 and the
total energy 𝑑𝑈, this relationship is inversely proportional to
the displacement and quadratically dependent on the applied
force. This means that a structure with half of the mass of
another tends to have much higher values of kinetic energy
than if it is only slightly lighter.

As can be seen in Table 2, model A (the lightest) has
a mass almost 50% that of model B, which is the heaviest.
Models C and D have very similar mass and they are around
80% as heavy as B. Nevertheless, models B and C present
a much more similar behaviour in their quasistatic kinetic
energies.

Again, for relatively small differences in mass, the influ-
ence of the entropy has more importance than the effect of
the structural inertial forces.

Figure 14 shows a plot of the temperature against kinetic
energy for all four models. Here it is possible to observe
the linear dependence between these two variables although
they were computed from mathematically independent

relationships. This is in accordance with the thermodynamic
kinetic theory, by means of which temperature is a parameter
in relation to the movement of the particles of a system.

Unfortunately, in this study a numerical correlation
between the two quantities was not found. It would be more
correct to search this correlation within the context of time-
history analysis, where also velocities and accelerations could
be taken into account. Nevertheless, this is a very promising
result that encourages further research.

In Figure 15, the deformed shapes of the four structures
are shown for comparison. How model D “activates” the
rotational degrees of freedom of extra nodes can be seen,
increasing its internal energy. This explains how this model
can create points of high concentration of stresses, hence

reducing its entropy. Similarly, model A also presents rotated
beams whereas in models B and C these remain straight.

4. Discussion and Future Work

In the present work a series of quantities from statistical
mechanics have been defined to describe and compare the
properties of a set of structures.The values of these quantities
were obtained by assimilating certain structural systems to an
aggregate of interconnected nodes undergoing a quasistatic
process of thermodynamic change. In this manner, it was
possible to define

(i) the number of nodes, 𝑁, corresponding to the size of
the assembled matrices,

(ii) the internal energy, 𝑑𝑈, as the amount of work done
by the external forces on the structural system,

(iii) the internal strain energy, 𝛿𝑊, as the amount of such
work mechanically stored in the nodes,

(iv) the added heat, 𝛿𝑄, as the energy dissipated in the
form of displacements,

(v) the change in entropy, 𝑑𝑆, as a measure of the degree
to which 𝛿𝑊 is evenly distributed throughout the
nodes,

(vi) the temperature, 𝑇, as the ratio between the added
heat and the entropy,

(vii) the internal quasistatic kinetic energy, KEqs, as a
measure of the influence of the mass of the system.

These properties have been identified in a group of four
structural configurations adopted from the seismic regu-
lation Eurocode 8. The choice of a structural engineering
reference provides our framework with a sound background
for the establishing of comparisons and, more importantly, a
handy factor, 𝑞, which is called a “behaviour factor.”

There seems to be a possibility of characterizing this
empirical factor in a more rigorous manner by means of
the definition of a value of entropy for each structural
configuration.

We have also presented a novel application of entropy
in order to define the degree to which internal energy is
evenly distributed within a structure. Uniform distribution
of this energy, being dependent on internal stresses, means
a lower likelihood of encountering overstressed points while
underutilizing others. Structures with high values of entropy
are less likely to present local failures and will do so only after
resourcing all of its available elements.

From our experiments, more flexibility also means lower
entropy. However, a more flexible structure can also respond
to a much wider range of applied energies. It is the trade-off
between material economy, energetic capacity, and entropy
which makes a good structural design.

It was concluded that the techniques developed for ana-
lyzing systems from the point of view of statistical mechanics
work very well with structural systems.

Within the framework presented in this paper, it is
possible to determinewhether a structural systemwill require

from its elements the ability to store applied energy or to
deform in order to dissipate it, and to what extent.

This work opens up the possibility of some additional
interactions, such as

(i) the study of applications to real built structures,
(ii) the application to algorithms for the study of nonlin-

ear behaviours,
(iii) the extension of the simulations to time-history anal-

ysis for the characterization of a term of “structural
temperature,”

(iv) the research in the characterization of the externally
applied loads as sources of energy, so that the whole
system can be treated as an energetic exchange pro-
cess,

(v) experimentation with different laws for the fitting of
the probabilities in order to see how they affect the
computation of entropy,

(vi) the possibility of combining together the defined par-
ameters with optimization techniques; their straight-
forward identification with qualitative properties

makes them ideal candidates as design target vari-
ables,

(vii) the extension to different types of finite elements
other than Timoshenko beams.
