Abstract 

The aim of this work is to carry out numerical simulations in the time domain of seakeeping 

problems taking into account internal flow in tanks, including sloshing. To this aim, a Smooth 

Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) solver for simulating internal flows in tanks is coupled in the time 

domain to a Finite Element Method (FEM) diffraction–radiation solver developed for seakeeping 

problems. Validations are carried out comparing against available experimental data. Good 

agreement between obtained numerical results and experimental data is found. 

 

1. Introduction 

There are a series of marine operations and/or navigation conditions in which the coupling between 

internal flow in tanks and seakeeping dynamics can be crucial in configuring the global dynamic 

response of the vessel. The assessment of such coupling effects may be thus extremely important 

in order to estimate the viability of certain operations as well as the risks associated to specific 

load conditions during navigation. Such navigation conditions and/or operations include: those 

carried out by offshore vessels, equipped with anti-roll tanks, commonly in the oil&gas industry, 

consisting of deploying piping systems, cables, drilling equipment, etc. (see e.g. Neves et al., 

2009); those referred to the offloading of oil or Liquefied natural gas (LNG) from an floating 

production storage and offloading (FPSO) platform, bunkering vessel or a floating LNG (FLNG) 

to a shuttle, regular vessel or LNG carrier, respectively, in side-by-side configurations (see e.g. 

Watai et al., 2015); the transport in partially filled tanks of such LNG or its storage in FLNG tanks 

(see Zhao et al., 2011, for a review on FLNG vessels hydrodynamics).

Due to their large economic cost and much larger penalties in case of any unexpected problem, the 

planning of above mentioned operations or the definition of filling level thresholds of tanks, 

requires a deep understanding of the coupled dynamics between the vessel and the internal flows. 

In order to achieve such understanding it is important to notice that while the external dynamics 

can be usually resolved in relatively large time scales, the internal dynamics may incorporate 

violent sloshing flows, which requires resolving complex free-surface dynamics with much shorter 

time scales. In addition, when wave excitation is present, for low wave amplitudes, the motions 

are usually linear with amplitude and frequency while for moderate or large wave amplitudes, the 

response can be extremely nonlinear. For these reasons, in order to simultaneously resolve the 

seakeeping and internal flow dynamics, different types of solvers are typically used for each of 

them. For instance, Zhao et al. (2014a) use a frequency domain linear boundary element method 

(BEM) approach to obtain hydrodynamic coefficients and wave forces, which is coupled in the 

time–domain with a nonlinear potential solver for the internal dynamics. Another example is the 

commonly cited reference of Kim et al. (2007) who also resort to frequency domain calculations 

and resolve the internal flow modeled with Euler equations, with a finite difference scheme. With 

the same technique for ship motions Li et al. (2012) solved the internal flows with the widespread 

used open-source volume of fluid (VOF) based solver OpenFOAM. 

Regarding the numerical method traditionally adopted for seakeeping simulation, the boundary 

element method (BEM) has dominated over others like finite element method (FEM). We might 

find the reason in the fact that most of the computational effort is spent in solving the Laplace 

equation. Then it might look like BEM offers a lower computational effort. However, Cai et al. 

(1998) carried out a heuristic study regarding the computational effort required for solving the 

Laplace equation by BEM and FEM. This study concluded that for a similar three-dimensional 

problem and a discretization size, the number of unknowns of BEM and FEM are O(N2) and O(N3), 

respectively, being N the number of unknowns needed in one dimension to achieve the desired 

discretization. But the computational costs are O(N4) and O(N3) respectively. Therefore, while 

BEM might be more efficient for problems with low number of unknowns, FEM becomes more 

efficient respect to BEM as the number of unknowns increases. Considering that computational 

capabilities continuously increases, so does the complexity of problems to be undertaken, and the 

number of unknowns required. Hence FEM become more efficient than BEM.

Time–domain diffraction–radiation solvers based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) have been 

previously used (see Ma and Yan, 2009, Serván-Camas and García-Espinosa, 2013). Their 

capability to naturally incorporate non-linearities is larger than those time–domain solvers based 

on frequency domain pre-calculations such as the ones used by Kim et al. (2007), Li et al. (2012), 

or Zhao et al. (2014a). Those solvers have been successfully used with coupled mooring models 

(Ma and Yan, 2009), in side-by-side (Yan and Ma, 2011) or even in multi-body configurations 

(Serván-Camas and García-Espinosa, 2013). 

FEM based solvers have, however, to the authors’ knowledge, not yet been used to model coupled 

sloshing and ship motions. Due to the onset of violent sloshing, internal dynamics can be extremely 

complex and therefore computationally expensive to resolve. In this context, Smoothed Particle 

Hydrodynamics (SPH) solvers can be a competitive option since, on the one hand, they are able to 

cope with extremely non-linear and fragmented free-surface flows, and on the other hand, they are 

easily parallelized with cost competitive graphic card processing units. 

SPH solvers have been successfully used in the past for solving coupled dynamics of single degree 

of freedom angular motion coupled sloshing problems (Bouscasse et al., 2014a, 2014b, Bulian et 

al., 2010) and their parallelization with GPUs has been subject of significant recent attention (see 

e.g. Crespo et al. 2011; Domingues et al. 2013; Herault et al. 2010; Nishiura et al. 2015). In this 

paper, the internal flow dynamics is solved using AquaGPUSPH (Cercós-Pita, 2015) and the 

seakeeping dynamics is solved with SeaFEM (Serván-Camas and García-Espinosa, 2013). Both 

solvers, AquaGPUSPH and SeaFEM, have been developed by the authors. 

The paper is organized as follows: section 2 introduces the internal flow and wave diffraction–

radiation solvers; section 3 describes the rigid body dynamics solver; section 4 focuses on the 

details of the coupling algorithm, as well as in the communication between solvers; section 5 

presents a validation study comparing the results obtained in this work against experimental data 

available for three different case scenarios; finally, section 6 provides the conclusions of this work. 

 

2. Internal flow and seakeeping solvers 

Let’s mention that the seakeeping and internal flow solvers are independently developed, 

compiled, and distributed software. On one hand, the seakeeping solver is SeaFEM, a potential 

FEM time domain suite of tools for seakeeping simulation [1] developed by the International 

Center of Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE) [2], in collaboration with CompassIS [1].

On the other hand, the internal flow solver is AQUAgpusph, an open-source 3D SPH solver, 

accelerated with OpenCL in order to run on GPUs, developed by the Model Basin Research Group 

[3] of the Technical University of Madrid. 

 

2.1. Internal flow solver: AQUAgpusph 

2.1.1. General. 

AQUAgpusph (Cercós-Pita, 2015) is a recently released free 3D SPH solver, licensed under 

GPLv3, and accelerated with OpenCL. AQUAgpusph source code along with developers' 

documentation, a gallery of images, videos, validation cases and a news blog, is available for 

downloading at [4]. AQUAgpusph validation is thoroughly documented in Cercós-Pita (2015), 

where it was used to model the sloshing flows inside a Lead-cooled Fast Nuclear Reactor during 

an earthquake, focusing on the evaluation of the loads caused by the fluid on the structure. In 

Cercós-Pita (2015) the solver is validated regarding fluid loads on walls (with emphasis on 

pressure loads) in dam-break flows and for a TLD case which works as a canonical representation 

of an anti-roll tank (Bouscasse et al., 2014a, 2014b; Bulian et al., 2010). The internal solver has 

been also used to simulate the influence of an anti-roll tank in a nonlinear ship motions solver 

based on pre-calculated (in frequency domain) diffraction forces (Cercos-Pita et al., 2016, 2016b). 

 

2.1.2. SPH method. 

SPH is a meshless numerical method that was developed in the seventies and first applied in the 

nineties to free-surface flows (Monaghan, 1994), and is based on the following convolution 

integral: 

⟨𝐟(𝐱)⟩ =
1

𝛾(𝐱)
∫ 𝐟(𝐲)𝑊(|𝐱 − 𝐲|, ℎ)
Ω

𝑑𝐲 (1) 

where 𝐟 is a scalar or vectorial function, 𝑊 is an even kernel function (In this specific application 

a Quintic Wendland function is considered), Ω is the fluid domain, and 𝛾(𝐱) is a renormalization 

factor: 

𝛾(𝐱) = ∫ 𝑊(|𝐱 − 𝐲|, ℎ)
Ω

𝑑𝐲 (2) 

The same convolution integral can be applied to a generic differential operator 𝐷, 



5 
 

⟨𝐷𝐟(𝐱)⟩ =
1

𝛾(𝐱)
∫ 𝐷𝐟(𝐲)𝑊(|𝐱 − 𝐲|, ℎ)
Ω

𝑑𝐲 (3) 

where ⟨𝐷𝐟(𝐱)⟩ is generally unknown. However, expanding the expression and applying the 

divergence theorem the differential operator can be conveniently moved to the kernel function: 

⟨𝐷𝐟(𝐱)⟩ =
1

𝛾(𝐱)
(∫ 𝐟(𝐲) ∙ ∇𝑊(𝐲 − 𝐱, ℎ)
Ω

𝑑𝐲 + ∫ 𝐟(𝐲) ∙ 𝐧(𝐲)𝑊(|𝐱 − 𝐲|, ℎ)
∂Ω

𝑑𝐲) (4) 

In the previous equation 𝐧 is the outward oriented normal at the boundary. Traditionally the 

renormalization factor 𝛾(𝐱) and the first integral (so called the boundary integral) have been 

neglected by the usage of fluid extensions to enforce the boundary conditions. However, in recent 

years, the possibility of keeping these terms is attracting the interest of the researchers (see Cercos-

Pita, 2015; Ferrand et al., 2013; Macià et al., 2012), and, as a matter of fact, they have been retained 

in the present implementation. 

Hence, the SPH convolution (Eq.(1)) allows the evaluation of differential operators using the 

already known field values. For practical purposes, the integrals in Eq. (4) are numerically 

evaluated by discretizing the fluid domain in a set of particles, transporting the flow properties in 

a Lagrangian framework. To this end, for a generic particle𝑎, the differential of volume is 

computed as 𝑑𝐲 = 𝑚𝑎/𝜌𝑎, where 𝑚𝑎 is the constant mass of the particle, and 𝜌𝑎 its density. 

Therefore, the discrete version of the operators read: 

⟨𝐷𝐟⟩𝑎 = −
1

𝛾𝑎
( ∑ 𝐟b

𝑏∈Ω

𝑚𝑏
𝜌𝑏

+ ∑ 𝐟b
𝑏∈𝜕Ω

∙ 𝐧𝑏𝑊(|𝐫𝑎 − 𝐫𝑏|, ℎ)𝑠𝑏) (5) 

with 𝑠𝑏 being the area of a generic boundary element 𝑏. 

2.1.3. Governing equations. 

The methodology described above can be applied to the Navier–Stokes equations in a weakly 

compressible Lagrangian formulation:

where 𝐮𝑎 is the velocity of a generic material particle a, 𝐠 is the gravity force, 𝜌0 and 𝑐0 are the 

density and the speed of sound of the fluid respectively, Γ is an incompressibility factor, and 𝐓 is 

the stress tensor. 

2.1.4. Discretization. 

For conservation and consistency reasons (see Colagrossi et al., 2009, 2011, 2013), the above 

differential operators are not directly approximated using equation Eq. (5), but are conveniently 

symmetrized. More specifically, the approximations of the differential operators practised in this 

work read as follows: 

𝜌𝑎⟨∇∙ 𝐮⟩𝑎 =
1

𝛾𝑎
( ∑ (𝐮b − 𝐮𝑎)

𝑏∈Ω

(12) 

Although turbulence modeling has not been used, Colagrossi et al. (2011, 2013, 2015) and 

Bouscasse et al. (2014 a,b) showed that SPH can model fairly accurately turbulent dissipation in 

this kind of free-surface flows, even in the presence of wave breaking. As a matter of fact, 

Bouscasse et al. (2014 a,b) used this capability to model with SPH a coupled sloshing and angular 

motion problem. 

2.1.5. Boundary conditions. 

Regarding boundary conditions, considering the negligible effect of boundary layers on this kind 

of sloshing flows, free-slip boundary conditions have been imposed. To this aim, boundary 

integrals, first introduced by Campbell (1989), and formalized later by Kulasegaram et al. (2003), 

De Leffe et al. (2009), Ferrand et al. (2013) and Macià et al. (2012) have been used. This method 

is based on the contour integral presented in eq. (4) and discretized in equations (10)-(11). Since 

free slip conditions are imposed, boundary does not affect the viscous term computation and is not 

included in eq. (12). 

To use this technique, the geometrical boundary is discretized in flat area elements whose typical 

size is that of the inter-particle distance. The main advantages of this technique are (see Cercos-

Pita, 2015): 

1. It is efficient both in memory consumption and in computational time. 



7 
 

2. It is able to deal with complex geometries. 

3. It is fully consistent in the many neighbors limit; contrary to other boundary techniques such 

as ghost fluids (see Macià et al., 2012 for details). 

2.1.6. Numerical aspects. 

The purely explicit numerical scheme presented above, corresponding to the Weakly-

Compressible formulation (Monaghan, 1994), may lead to numerical instabilities unless either 

extremely small time steps, or additional diffusion, are used. Considering this, the δ-SPH diffusive 

term has been used in this work (see Antuono et al. 2012, 2015), including it in equation (10) as 

𝜌𝑎⟨∇∙ 𝐮⟩𝑎 =
1

𝛾𝑎
( ∑ (𝐮b − 𝐮𝑎)

𝑏∈Ω

∙ ∇𝑊𝑎𝑏𝑚𝑏 + ∑ (𝐮b − 𝐮𝑎)

𝑏∈𝜕Ω

∙ 𝐧𝑏𝑊𝑎𝑏𝜌𝑏𝑠𝑏) + 𝛿ℎ𝑐0𝒟 𝑎 . (13) 

This diffusive term incorporates a non-dimensional coefficient  whose value is taken as 0.2, an 

optimal one as discussed in Antuono et al. (2012). The factor 𝒟 𝑎 is an approximation to the second 

derivative of the density field using the following expression 

𝒟 𝑎 = ∑ 𝜓𝑏𝑎
(𝐫b − 𝐫𝑎) ∙ ∇𝑊𝑎𝑏

(𝐫b − 𝐫𝑎)
2

𝑏∈Ω

∙
𝑚𝑏
𝜌𝑏

. (14) 

Different formulations for the factor 𝜓𝑏𝑎 are available in the literature. The one chosen here is that 

of Antuono et al. (2012), which preserves mass conservation and is exact for hydrostatic fields.  

Regarding the time integration scheme, Souto et al. (2006) discussed in detail a modified predictor-

corrector, second order in space and first order in velocities and densities, which has been used in 

present study. The time step has been chosen so that considering a Courant condition on the 

pressure waves propagation (the most restrictive in this problem) is fulfilled, namely 

∆𝑡 𝑆𝑃𝐻 = 0.25
ℎ

𝑐0
 (15) 

2.1.7. Code acceleration and parallelization. 

AQUAgpusph code adds up to existing free graphic processor unit (GPU) accelerated alternatives, 

namely the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) based GPUSPH (Herault et al., 2010) 

and DualSPHysics (Crespo et al., 2011). A performance comparison with these solvers is provided 

in Cercós-Pita (2015). Main differences with such implementations include: First, AQUAgpusph 

has been accelerated and parallelized with OpenCL. Second, commonly used boundary condition 

schemes have been implemented, including the boundary integrals used in present study (Macià, 



8 
 

2012). Third, AQUAgpusph is Python extensible, which allows to customize and couple solid 

body motions.  

The key features that led to use the OpenCL instead of other alternatives like CUDA, OpenMP or 

MPI (all successfully used in other SPH implementations), can be summarized in the following 

list: (1) Hardware diversification: OpenCL is not restricted to GPUs, CPUs, or IBM Cell 

architecture, but is able to deal with all of them. This feature must be taken into consideration 

when a framework is selected, not only because the architecture may not be the best one, but also 

because OpenCL is likely easier to adapt to new architectures that will be created in the future. 

Other SPH developments require 3 different versions of the software: a serial CPU version, a 

parallel CPU version and a CUDA based version for GPUs. With OpenCL standard, a unique 

version of the code can cover all these versions, and moreover, it can do it simultaneously, allowing 

the use of GPUs and CPUs in the same simulation. (2) Highly moddable application: OpenCL is 

based on the GLSL working method, where the codes that will be executed in the computation 

device can be loaded and compiled in run time, allowing relying on external files. 

 

2.2. Potential flow solver 

The seakeeping solver includes a rigid body dynamics solver and a wave diffraction–radiation 

solver. The rigid body dynamics solver is described in the following section with details on the 

coupling with AQUAgpusph. Regarding the wave diffraction–radiation solver, we consider the 

wave problem governed by potential flow theory:

where 𝜑 is the velocity potential, ξ is the free surface elevation, Ω is the fluid domain, ΓB 

represents the wetted surface of the present bodies, 𝒗𝑝 represents the local body velocity on the 



9 
 

body surface, 𝒗𝜑 is the velocity induce by 𝜑, 𝒏𝑝 is the normal vector at Γ𝐵, and  H is the water 

depth. And the pressure at any given point P is 

𝑃𝑝 = −𝜌

Applying Taylor series expansion of the free surface boundary conditions around 𝑧 = 0, 

introducing a Stokes’ perturbation solution 𝜑 = 𝜑1 + 𝜑2 + ⋯ and ξ = ξ1 + ξ2 + ⋯, and retaining 

the first order terms, the first order wave problem is governed by 

Δ𝜑1 = 0 𝑖𝑛 Ω, (22)

and the pressure at any given point P is

− 𝜌𝑔𝑧𝑝 pressure at a point P. (27) 

From this point on, the superscript “1” will be omitted since only first order approach will be 

discussed. Next, the solution is decomposed as 𝜑 = 𝜓 + 𝜙 and ξ =ζ+ 𝜂, where 𝜓 and ζ are 

the incident wave velocity potential and free surface elevation respectively, and fulfill 

Δ𝜓 = 0 𝑖𝑛 Ω, (28)

Hence the incident waves are described by the well solution to Eqs.  (36)-(40) : 

𝜓 = ∑
𝐴𝑖𝑔

𝜔𝑖

cosh(|𝒌𝑖|(𝐻+𝑧))

cosh(|𝒌𝑖|𝐻)
sin(𝒌𝑖𝒙 − 𝜔𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖)𝑖 , (32)  

ζ = ∑ 𝐴𝑖 cos(𝒌𝑖𝒙 − 𝜔𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖)𝑖 , (33)  

where 𝒌𝒊 =
2𝜋

𝐿𝑖
(cos(𝛾𝑖) , sin(𝛾𝑖)), 𝐿𝑖 is the wave length, 𝛾𝑖 is the wave direction of propagation, 

𝜔𝑖 is the wave frequency, and 𝛿𝑖 is a phase delay. The following dispersion relation holds: 



10 
 

𝜔𝑖
2 = 𝑔|𝒌𝑖| tanh(|𝒌𝑖|𝐻), (34)  

and the fluid pressure induced by the incident waves at a point P is given by 

𝑃𝑝𝜓 = ∑ 𝜌𝑔𝐴𝑖
cosh(|𝒌𝑖|(𝐻+𝑧))

cosh(|𝒌𝑖|𝐻)
cos (𝒌𝑖𝒙 − 𝜔𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖)𝑖 . (35)  

𝜙 and 𝜂 are the diffraction–radiation velocity potential and free surface elevation respectively. Then, the  

first order wave diffraction–radiation is govern by the following equations: 

∇2𝜙 = 0 in Ω, (36) 

∂tt𝜙 + 𝑔 ∂𝑧𝜙 = 0 on 𝑧 = 0, (37) 

∂𝑧𝜙 = 0 on 𝑧 = −𝐻, (38) 

∇𝜙 ∙ 𝒏𝐵 = (𝒗𝐵 − ∇ψ ) ∙ 𝒏𝐵 on  Γ𝐵, (39) 

η = −
1

g
∂t𝜙 on 𝑧 = 0. (40) 

And the pressure induce at a point P is 

𝑃𝑝 = −𝜌
𝜕𝜙

𝜕𝑡
− 𝜌𝑔𝑧𝑝 pressure at a point P. (41) 

In the previous equations, the domain is assumed to be infinite in the horizontal directions. 

However, an infinite domain cannot be considered from a numerical point of view. Since waves 

represented by ϕ are born at the bodies and propagate in all directions away from the bodies, these 

waves have to either be dissipated or be let go out of the domain so they will not come back and 

interact with the bodies. Then, a Sommerfeld radiation condition at the edge of the computational 

domain will be used: 

∂t𝜙 + 𝑐𝑅∇𝜙 ∙ 𝒏𝑅 = 0 on  Γ𝑅 (42) 

where ΓR is the surface limiting of the domain in the horizontal directions, cR is a prescribed 

wave phase velocity, and 𝒏𝑅 is the normal vector at ΓR. The numerical scheme used for Eq. (42) is 

as follows: 

𝜙𝑛+1 − 𝜙𝑛

Δ𝑡
=  −𝑐𝑅(∇𝜙)

𝒏+𝟏 ∙ 𝒏𝑅 on  Γ𝑅 (43) 

where 𝑐𝑅 is calculated as the phase velocity of the waves with smaller frequency (larger waves). 

Eq. (42) will let waves with phase velocity 𝑐𝑅 to escape out of the domain. However, waves with 

different phase velocities (shorter waves) will not be leaving the domain. Then, wave dissipation 

is inserted into the dynamic free surface boundary condition by varying the pressure at the free 

surface such that 

Pn+1/ρ = Pa/ρ +κ(𝐱)(∂zϕ)
𝑛+1  (44) 



11 
 

where κ(𝐱) is a damping coefficient that is set to zero in the near field around the body (no 

dissipation), and increase gradually, starting at a given distance from the body, in order to dissipate 

the waves diffracted and radiated by the body. 

The associated matrix form to the former governing equations using FEM is 

�̿�𝛟 = 𝐛B + 𝐛Z0 + 𝐛Z−H + 𝐛R (45) 

where �̿� is the standard laplacian matrix, and 𝐛B,𝐛Z0 , 𝐛Z−H and 𝐛R are the vectors obtained by 

integrating the corresponding boundary condition on  Γ𝐵, 𝑧 = 0, 𝑧 = −𝐻, and Γ𝑅. 

A fourth order Padé scheme is used for integrating the free surface boundary condition, and a 

fourth order finite difference is used for the kinematic boundary condition:

The time step Δ𝑡 is obtained based on the following stability criteria: 𝑔Δ𝑡2/ℎ < 𝛽; where ℎ is 

the minimum length in the vertical direction of the free surface discretization elements, and 𝛽 a 

stability limit which is order 1, depending on the discretization used. 

More numerical details regarding the body dynamics and wave diffraction–radiation solvers can 

be found in Serván-Camas and García-Espinosa (2013). 

 

3. Body dynamics problem 

Under the assumption of small rotations, which is a usual assumption in seakeeping problems, the 

body dynamics of the floating device is described by the equation of motion (using a frame of 

reference with origin at the gravity center of the body): 

M̿�̈� = 𝐅ext (48) 

where M̿ is the body mass matrix, �̈� is the body acceleration vector, and 𝐅ext is the total external 

forces and moments vector. Inertias, All external loads, including hydrodynamic, hydrostatic, 

wave, and those coming from the internal flow calculations, are included in 𝐅ext. Then, Eq. (48) is 

solved using n implicit Newark’s average acceleration method. 

𝐅ext is introduced straightforwardly into the body dynamic solver. Hence, the body dynamic solver 

will account for the non-linearities generated in the internal flow calculations, among others that 

could be considered. 



12 
 

The dynamics solver is integrated in the diffraction–radiation solver package used to calculate the 

action of wave loads on the floating body. Then, since the body dynamics solver is implicit and 

non-linear, it requires iterating in order to achieve convergence within each time step. As shown 

in Figure 1, there are two iterative loops within each time step. Where 𝐗 is the body position vector, 

�̇� is the body velocity vector, �̈� is the body acceleration vector, 𝐅0 are the external forces other 

than hydrodynamic loads, 𝐅H are hydrodynamic loads, and 𝐅SPH is the internal tanks vector of 

forces and moments computed by the SPH solver. With regards to superscripts, “n” represent the 

current time step, “k” represents the k-th iteration of the solver loop, and “l” represents the l-th 

iteration of the body dynamics loop.

On the one hand, the outer loop iterates over the hydrodynamics solver obtained from the 

diffraction–radiation problem. On the other hand, the inner loop iterates over the body dynamics 

solver updating any other loads acting on the body dynamics. 

Looking at Figure 1, it can be observed that the diffraction–radiation problem and the body 

dynamics are solved within the time marching loop, and hence the same time step is used for both 

solvers. Regarding the SPH solver, it requires a smaller time step, and the exchange of data with 

the body dynamic solver will be carried out once per time step. 

Regarding the body dynamics equations, the α Bossak-Newmark’s average acceleration method 

was implemented (Wood et al., 2005). The iterative procedure of the inner loop requires a 

relaxation schemes to ensure convergence. Aitkens method was used to relax body accelerations 

with the aim of accelerating the convergence of the iterative algorithm (Irons and Tuck, 1969). Let 

∆ be the standard difference operator, and l the iteration counter, the resulting algorithm of the 

body dynamics loop can be written as: 

(a)  Set iteration  𝑙 = 1. 

(b)  Compute forces and moments acting on body:  𝐅ext,𝑙 = 𝐅ext(�̈�r,𝑙
t ). 

(c)  Solve:   (1 −α)M̿�̈�𝑙+1
t +αM̿�̈�t−∆t = 𝐅ext,𝑙. 

(d)  Compute relaxation factor:   𝜔𝑙+1 = 1 − 𝜔𝑙 [1 −

(e)  Relaxation step:   �̈�r,𝑙+1

(f)  Check convergence. If not reached advance iteration 𝑙 = 𝑙 + 1 and go to (b). 

 

4. Coupling scheme 

4.1. Communication issues 

The seakeeping and internal flow solvers used in this work are independently developed, compiled, 

and distributed software. Therefore, the development and implementation of a communication 

strategy between them is a key point of the work.   

The general idea of the designed coupling scheme is trivial: body movements calculated by the 

seakeeping solver are sent to the internal flow solver where forces and moments are evaluated and 

sent back to the seakeeping solver. 

For the exchange of data, the seakeeping solver has a TCL interface, allowing to execute TCL 

scripts that can access different internal data structures of the solver during the calculation process. 



14 
 

For its part, the internal flow solver includes a Python-based interface, developed to interchange 

data with external sources.   

In order to implement the communication scheme, a TCL script [5] was built, which is responsible 

for the communication between the two programs. This script is interpreted and executed by the 

seakeeping solver and communicates with different instances of the internal flow solver. Figure 2 

explains the communication scheme used. 

The exchange of data is carried out with respect to an instantaneous reference system. Tables 1 

and 2 show the data sent from the seakeeping solver to the internal flow solver and vice versa. 

The instantaneous reference system at time=t, R(t)XtYtZt, is defined such that R(0)X0Y0Z0 

coincides with the global reference system OXYZ, R(t) describes the trajectory of the point of  the 

rigid body located initially at the origin of the global system, and axes XtYtZt are parallel to the 

global axes. To further understand the reference systems used, a simple rigid body movement is 

presented at Figure 3 showing the displacements and rotations.

4.2. Coupling algorithm 

The key point in this work is how the coupling between the two solvers is carried out. As 

aforementioned, both solvers run in the time domain. Therefore, the coupling is based on the 

exchange of data in Tables 1 and 2 at some specific time steps while both are running. The time 

step required by the SPH solver (ΔtSPH) stability criteria is usually in the order of 10 to 1000 times 

smaller than the time step used by the seakeeping solver (ΔtFEM), depending on the case under 

study, the grid resolution and number of particles. Then, an explicit staggered approach was 

selected as the most adequate to couple both solvers. This scheme is summarized next: 

1. Loads calculated by the internal flow solver at 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 = 𝑛Δ𝑡𝐹𝐸𝑀 are sent to the seakeeping 

solver. 

2. The seakeeping solver extrapolates loads from the internal flow solver at 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 = (𝑛 + 1)

Δ𝑡𝐹𝐸𝑀 using a five points Lagrange polynomial. 

3. The seakeeping solver calculates movements at 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 = (𝑛 + 1)Δ𝑡𝐹𝐸𝑀. 

4. The seakeeping solver sends movements to the internal flow solver at 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 = (𝑛 + 1)Δ

𝑡𝐹𝐸𝑀. 

5. The internal flow solver runs from 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 = 𝑛Δ𝑡𝐹𝐸𝑀 to  𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 = (𝑛 + 1)Δ𝑡𝐹𝐸𝑀 

interpolating the body movements sent by the seakeeping solver from 𝑛Δ𝑡𝐹𝐸𝑀 to (𝑛 + 1)

Δ𝑡𝐹𝐸𝑀.

Figure 4 provides the details of the coupling algorithm implemented between the seakeeping and 

internal flow solvers, where 𝐅 and 𝐌 are the forces and moments sent to the seakeeping solver 

respectively, 𝐅𝐞 and 𝐌𝐞 are the extrapolated forces and moments respectively, 𝐑 and 𝚯 are the 

linear and angular movement of the internal tank respectively, and 𝐕𝐑 and 𝐖 are the linear and 

angular velocities of the internal tank respectively. Figure 1 also shows how external forces and 

moments are introduced in the body dynamics solver at the beginning of the time step, and how 

the movements are sent to the SPH solver once the dynamics solver has converged.

5. Validation 

5.1. Barge with water in tanks. 

5.1.1. Case description 

In order to validate the present coupled internal flow-seakeeping solver, experimental results 

obtained by Molin et al. (2002) were used to compare with. The experiments consist on the study 

of the seakeeping response of a barge-like ship, where a tank is extending over a relatively large 

part of the model. There are two tanks next to each other at the mid-ship whose transverse 

dimension is close to the model breadth. Figure 5 shows the barge layout with the tanks and Figure 

6 shows the unstructured mesh used in the seakeeping solver for the present case study. The mesh 

size in the floating line is 2.5 cm, and a total of 236,144 tetrahedral elements were used.  

 

 

Figure 5: Barge with tanks.

Figure 6: FEM mesh. 

 

 

5.1.2 Case 1: same water level in tanks. 

The first case study to analyze is that where the water level is 19cm in both tanks. To achieve the 

target draft of 10.8cm, additional mass of 40kg was added on the deck of the barge. Table 3 

provides the particulars of the barge including the additional mass. Only roll values were provided 

in Molin et al. (2002). Numerical simulations were carried out with free sway, heave and roll in 

order to better approximate the experiments. Since both tanks are filled with the same water level, 

and movements are occurring in the OYZ plane, only one tank was simulated and the second was 

assumed to behave equally. 

Figure 7 represents the experimental results for the case study where both tanks are filled with the 

same water level (19 cm). The roll rao in the experiments was obtained via spectral analysis from 

irregular motion tests. The wave spectrum used was a JONSWAP with particulars provided in 

Table 4.

5.1.2.1 Monochromatic wave test 

First, a calibration of the roll damping to account for viscous effects is carried out. A 

monochromatic test with wave amplitude of 2 cm and wave frequency ω = 4.026 rad/s, which 

is where the first resonance appears. The test was carried out with 105 particles and it was found 

that 11% of the critical roll damping was necessary to reproduce the RAO value of the experiments, 

larger than the 8% of the critical damping in Ludvigsen et al. (2013). 

Secondly, several tests were carried out to check the effect of increasing the number of particles 

in the SPH solver. We select a wave frequency ω = 5.984 rad/s, which corresponds to the second 

resonance frequency in Figure 7. All cases were simulated including a damping factor of C =

0.11√4IxxK44 , where Ixx is the roll inertia of the system barge plus weights, and K44 is the roll 

hydrostatic restoring coefficient. 

Table 5 provides the roll amplitude obtained for each case. The amplification factor converges, 

slowly, to a value about 2.7.

500,000 2.64 

 

 

5.1.2.2 Irregular wave test 

Next a RAOs analysis test is carried out. The wave conditions used in the numerical simulation 

correspond to a JONSWAP spectrum with similar characteristics of that used in the experiments 

(see Table 4). 

The wave amplitude distribution used to mimic the irregular wave conditions of the experiments 

is provided in the Appendix A. The discretization of the wave spectrum was done using 51 

frequencies from 2.5 to rad/s (this is about the frequency resolution used for the experiments). Also 

a roll damping C = 0.11√4IxxK44 was used. 



22 
 

Figure 8 compares the results obtained in the present work using one hundred thousand particles 

against those from experiments and calculated by WADAM in Ludvigsen et al. (2013) using a 

potential flow approach to account for the fluid dynamics within the tank. It can be observed that 

while WADAM provides a smooth curve of results, experiments and the present work show a bit 

of noise in the obtained curve. We believe that this is because the SPH approach for the fluid flow 

in the tank is nonlinear, which contributes to energy transfer among frequencies.

and experiments Molin et al. (2002) [34] for same water level in tanks (19cm+19cm). 

 

 

For frequencies around ω = 6 rad/s, experiments show larger values than those obtained in the 

computational analyses. On the other hand, results obtained in this work are a bit larger than those 

obtained by WADAM, and they both compare quite well with the experiment for frequencies away 

from ω = 6 rad/s. 



23 
 

 

5.1.2.3 Computational time 

Table 6 provides some data regarding the computational effort needed for the present approach. 

The computational time corresponds to those cases presented at Section 5.1.1. It is observed that 

the calculation of the fluid flow within the tank using the SPH with more than 3.5·104 particles is 

much more expensive than calculating the seakeeping behavior. Furthermore, if the number of 

particles is bumped up to 5·105 then this solver takes more than 98% of the calculation time.

For all cases presented in Table 6, the artificial speed of sound for the SPH was set to 10m/s, and 

the maximum particle velocity during the simulation was in the order of 0.6m/s, which keeps the 

Mach number under 0.06. 

 

5.1.3 Case 2: different water level in tanks. 

The second case study to analyze is for the case where the water level in one tank is 19cm and in 

the other 39cm. No additional mass is necessary to achieve the target draft like in the previous case 

study. The wave amplitude distribution used to mimic the irregular wave conditions of the 

experiments is provided in Appendix A. The discretization of the wave spectrum was done using 

one 101 frequencies ranging from 2.5 to 8 rad/s (frequency resolution was increased respect to the 

experiments to be able to catch the middle resonance peak shown in the experiments). Also a roll 

damping C = 0.11√4IxxK44 was used. The main particulars of the barge for this case study are 

given in Table 7.

Figure 9 compares the results obtained in the present work against those from experiments and 

calculated by WADAM in Ludvigsen et al. (2013). 105 Particles were used in the 19cm filling 

tank, and two hundred thousand particles in the 39cm filling tank. In this case study, three 

resonance peaks appear. For frequencies around  ω = 4 rad/s  the largest deviation from 

numerical to experimental results is found. But, for frequencies that are around ω = 5.25 rad/s 

no apparent deviation of the peaks’ frequency is observed and the numerical results around the 

sharp peak achieve a very similar value to the experimental results. Finally, for frequencies around 

 ω = 7 rad/s, no deviation in frequency is observed, but numerical results are below the predicted 

peak value.

5.2 Antiroll tank analysis 

Bai and Rhee (1987) provided experimental RAOs, obtained in a model basin, for a supply vessel 

equipped with an anti-roll tank (ART).  Later on, Kim et. al (2002) and Kim et al. (2007)  carried 

out numerical simulations of a modified S175 hull in order to compare the results with the 

experimental data provided in Bai and Rhee (1987). The modified S175 hull used by Kim et. al 

(2007) was an approximation to the supply vessel used by Bai and Rhee and, despite of it, results 

obtained by Kim et. al (2007) numerically showed the same trends than the experimental ones. 

In this work, we followed Kim et. al (2007) approach using a modified S175 hull to approximate 

the supply hull used by Bai and Rhee (1987). We used the same aspect ratios of beam to length, 

and draft to length used by Kim et al. (2007), for the modified S175 hull and the ART. However, 

no information regarding the exact geometry was found, neither for the position of the gravity 

center nor for inertias. Therefore, we had to estimate some parameters as well as the hull form. 

We started with the S175 hull form provided by the ITTC web site. Then, we proceeded to scale 

the ship to fulfill the aspect ratios provided by Kim et. al (2007). The resulting geometry is 

provided in [6]. The longitudinal positions of the gravity center and ART was estimated as the 

longitudinal position of the buoyancy center. Transverse positions was set to Y=0 and the vertical 

position of the gravity center and roll radii of gyration were estimated to approximate roll RAOS 

results without ART provided by Kim et. al. (2007). Tables 8 and 9 provide the main particulars 

of the hull form and ART used in this work. Figure 10 shows the modified S175 hull with the ART 

in place.

Roll RAOs were obtained for a series of tests with monochromatic waves and were normalized 

with respect to the maximum wave slope Ak, where A is the wave amplitude, and k the wave 

number. Also a damping factor of C = √4IxxK44 was used to calibrate the RAO value near 

resonance. 



27 
 

Figure 11 compares the experimental results obtained by Bai and Rhee (1987) with the numerical 

results obtained in this work where the results are shown with and without ART. 104 Particles 

were used in the SPH solver for the ART SPH simulation. The modified S175 was calibrated to 

show a similar behavior to the supply vessel of Bai and Rhee without ART, as can be observed by 

comparing the RAOs results without ART. When inserting the ART the results tend to be the same 

to the ones obtained by Bai and Rhee with a very similar reduction of roll movements.

are obtained with maximum wave slope AK. 

 

 

Figure 12 presents snapshot of the modified S175 hull with the ART at the resonance wave 

frequency for the case when there is no ART.  It can be observed that the roll motion is very small, 

and the fluid flow inside the ART is very nonlinear, exhibiting wave breaking phenomena.

5.3 2D vessel including internal flows 

Zhao et al. (2014b) carried out a series of two-dimensional model tests to study the hydrodynamic 

performance of a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) section including internal flow oscillations. 

The reference FLNG section was ballasted with fresh water and equivalent solid weights 

respectively, to clarify the coupling effects. RAOs of both motion responses and internal sloshing 

flows were calculated based on measured data. Particulars of the vessel section, internal tank, and 

complete model are provided in Tables 10-12, and Figure 13 shows the 3D FEM mesh model used 

for the simulation.

A white noise spectrum, with an energy density approximated to the one used in the experiments, 

was used to carry out the simulations. It consists of 51 frequencies equally spaced between ωmin =

0.3918 rad/s and ωmax = 16.6165 rad/s, with a wave amplitude of A = 0.14 m. First of all, 

uncoupled simulations with the equivalent solid weight were carried out to calibrate damping 

coefficients. Comparing with the solid weight experimental results (see Figure 14, left), damping 

coefficients were estimated as  C33 = 0.2√4MK33 for heave, and C44 = 0.055√4IxxK44 for roll. 

Secondly, coupled simulations were carried out using around 104 particles within the tank. Raos 

comparisons are provided in Figure 14 (right). 

Overall, the results obtained in this work fit well the experimental results provided by Zhao et al. 

(2014b). Some differences appear regarding the resonance frequency in roll, which might be due 

to the experimental setup to enforce the 2D condition, which is not fully simulated in the 

computational model. Besides, the numerical results for the coupled problem shows a peak value 

in frequencies around the resonance frequency for the uncoupled problem. Although this effect is 

not present in the experimental results, it was observed in the previous case study with the antiroll 

tank. So the appearance of this peak is not surprising and the appearance or not is questionable. 

1. Conclusions 

In this work, a SPH flow solver and a FEM seakeeping solver were coupled to perform simulations 

of seakeeping dynamics and internal flows in tanks simultaneously. Both solvers run 

independently in the time–domain, hence a coupling algorithm, including a communication 

strategy, was developed. 

The SPH-FEM coupling showed to be effective for solving seakeeping dynamics coupled with 

internal flows including sloshing. It was validated for several cases against available experimental 

data, providing good agreement. For the specific case study of the modified S175 hull with antiroll 

tank, where sloshing effects were observed, good agreement was found, demonstrating the 

capability of incorporating highly non-linear phenomena. As a result, the proposed coupling 

strategy has the capability of performing complex seakeeping analysis coupled with highly non-

linear internal flows in reasonable computational times. 

This coupled solver will be applied in a future work to solve realistic problems including LNG 

transportation analysis and complex sloshing phenomena under different sea conditions.
