A social multi-criteria evaluation framework for solving a real-case problem of 
selecting a wind farm location in the regions of Urgell and La Conca de Barberà 
in Catalonia (northeast of Spain) is studied. This paper applies a qualitative 
MCDA approach based on linguistic labels assessment able to address 
uncertainty and deal with different levels of precision. This method is based on 
qualitative reasoning as an artificial intelligence technique for assessing and 
ranking multi-attribute alternatives with linguistic labels in order to handle 
uncertainty. This method is suitable for problems in the social framework such as 
energy planning which require the construction of a dialogue process among 
many social actors with high level of complexity and uncertainty. The method is 
compared with an existing approach, which has been applied previously in the 
wind farm location problem. This approach, consisting of an outranking method, 
is based on Condorcet original method. The results obtained by both approaches 
are analyzed and their performance in the selection of the wind farm location is 
compared in aggregation procedures. Although results show that both methods 
conduct to similar alternatives rankings, the study highlights both their 
advantages and drawbacks. 

Keywords. Absolute order-of-magnitude, Multi-criteria decision analysis,

1. Introduction 

Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) includes various collections of mathematical 
techniques related to decision support systems for non-deterministic environments to 
support decision makers in a large range of applications such as energy planning. Since 
the 1960s and 1970s, MCDA has been known as one of the comprehensive tools to 
study the solution for different kinds of problems in which several alternatives are 
described with respect to a set of variables (Figueira, Greco, & Ehrgott, 2005). Recently 
a large number of challenges related to environmental issues, especially sustainable 
energy strategies using multi-criteria evaluation methods are being considered (Liu, 
2007; Pohekar & Ramachandran, 2004; Wang, Jing, Zhang, & Zhao, 2009). Energy 
problems are addressing conflicting economic, technological, social and environmental 
aspects to provide an appropriate equilibrium of energy production and consumption

with minimum negative impact on environment. These aspects include several 
qualitative variables that are difficult to analyze and quantify; the information needed 
for their evaluation is imprecise and involves uncertainty. Some of the currently used 
MCDA methods support decision makers in all stages of the decision-making process 
by providing useful data to assess criteria with imprecise and uncertain value.  

The structure of multi-criteria methods involves a set of alternatives, the 
corresponding criteria and the weights allocated to each criterion.  The selection of the 
method depends on the specific type of problem, criteria features and context of use.  
For example, the problems in the social framework such as energy planning require the 
construction of a dialogue process among many social actors under uncertainty (Munda, 
2004). Some of the most common methods used to support energy policy systems and 
energy planning towards sustainability are Analytical Hierarchy Process, ELECTRE, 
PROMETHEE and TOPSIS methods (Pohekar & Ramachandran, 2004). There exist 
many different representation preferences formats that can be used in each model, such 
as preference orderings, utility values, multiplicative preference relations, fuzzy and 
qualitative preference relations. Generally, the variables which are defined by words or 
sentences rather than numbers in a natural or artificial language are called linguistic 
variables (Zadeh, 1975). These variables can be used to assess alternatives under 
uncertainty. Each linguistic value is characterized by a label and a meaning as syntactic 
and semantic values, respectively. These preferences can be defined by using a 
linguistic approach involving qualitative labels (computing with words), to handle the 
high level of complexity and uncertainty (Catalina, Virgone, & Blanco, 2011; Doukas, 
Karakosta, & Psarras, 2010). 

In this way, one of the systematic tools for assessment in social frameworks is 
Qualitative Reasoning (QR), which is a subfield of research in Artificial Intelligence 
(AI). This technique attempts to understand and explain the skill of human beings to 
reason without having precise knowledge. QR techniques are able to reason at a 
qualitative or symbolic level directly in terms of orders of magnitude. Qualitative 
absolute order-of-magnitude models were introduced by Dubois and Prade (1980), use 
QR models by means of a linguistic approach in terms of an interval algebra. It can be 
defined via intuitive landmark values, and it capable of working at different levels of 
precision (Forbus, 1984; Tapia García, del Moral, Martínez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2012). 
This technique can be integrated with multi-criteria decision making methods, such as 
TOPSIS, to evaluate alternatives with respect to different criteria for ranking problems.  

Linguistic approaches have been widely used in MCDA methods in several 
fields such as power generation for tri-generation systems (Jing, Bai, & Wang, 2012; 
Nieto-Morote, Ruz-vila, & Canovas-rodriguez, 2010; Wang, Jing, Zhang, Shi, & Zhang, 
2008), urban planning (Chang, Parvathinathan, & Breeden, 2008; Hsieh, Lu, & Tzeng, 
2004; Mosadeghi, Warnken, Tomlinson, & Mirfenderesk, 2015), Life Cycle Impact 
Assessment (Cherubini & Strømman, 2011) and many others. In energy planning, 
different aspects of environmental assessments have been considered in various studies, 
for example developing the local energy sources to rank energy alternatives (Goumas & 
Lygerou, 2000), evaluating water resources (Dai, Qi, Chi, Chen, & Yang, 2010), 
assessing renewable energy alternatives (Doukas et al., 2010; Kahraman, Cebi, & Kaya, 
2010; San Cristóbal, 2011) and finding optimal locations for energy projects (Aras, 
Erdoğmuş, & Koç, 2004; San Cristóbal, 2012; Yeh & Huang, 2014). Furthermore, 
different applications of fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods in energy 
planning can be found in Kahraman (2008). 

The two main aims of this paper are the application to a wind farm location 
problem of qualitative TOPSIS methodology by using linguistic labels in a social 



framework, and the comparison of its results with C-K-Y-L (Condorcet-Kemeny-
Young-Leveng) methodology, which was previously used in this specific case (Gamboa 
& Munda, 2007). This comparison between two models highlights their advantages and 
disadvantages and represents a first step in considering a possible integration of both 
methods in future studies.  

This article first describes the qualitative reasoning techniques and absolute 
order-of-magnitude theoretical framework. Next, it introduces qualitative TOPSIS 
methodology and the description of the algorithm which is applied to the wind farm 
location problem. Then, this method compares with the aggregation procedures of 
method based on Condorcet approach, and the results obtained in this application. 
Finally, it summarizes the main findings of the paper and some conclusions that maybe 
reached in future studies. 

2. Theoretical framework 

Qualitative reasoning techniques are an active subfield of research in AI applied to 
physical systems, where some magnitudes are not easy to quantify. Such techniques 
make it possible to reason at a qualitative or symbolic level, for example reasoning 
directly with respect to orders of magnitude. With such techniques, data can be 
managed in terms of absolute or relative orders-of-magnitude. Absolute orders-of-
magnitude models usually consider a discretization of the real line in intervals 
corresponding to different qualitative labels.  

The absolute order-of-magnitude (AOM) models are constructed via a partition 
of ℝ which defines the quantity space S. The partition is defined by a set of real 
landmarks. Each element of the partition stands for a basic qualitative label; the set of 
basic labels is represented by 𝕊∗ = {B1, … , Bn}. A general algebraic structure, called 
Qualitative Algebra, providing a mathematical structure which combines sign algebra 
and interval algebra is defined. This structure has been extensively studied by Travé-
Massuyès et al. (2005). Figure 1 shows the linguistic hierarchy of qualitative labels 
corresponding to the absolute order-of-magnitude space 𝕊7.  

Figure 1. The linguistic hierarchy corresponding to 𝕊7 

 

 
For example, the seven classes can correspond to the following seven labels: 

Negative Large (NL), Negative Medium (NM), Negative Small (NS), Zero (0), Positive 



Small (PS), Positive Medium (PM) and Positive Large (PL). In absolute order-of-
magnitude qualitative space, structures and the space of k-dimensional vectors of labels 
allow the representation of alternatives from linguistic evaluations of experts by basic 
label (e.g. [B1] = Negative Large) or non-basic labels ([B1 − B7] = Negative Large to 
Positive Large) which means that the expert doesn’t have any specific knowledge in this 
case. The level of precision from top to down is increased by the expert`s 
knowledge.Techniques based on order-of-magnitude reasoning have provided 
theoretical models that can obtain results from non-numeric variables. The main 
advantage of this method is the capability of dealing with problems in such a way that 
the principle of relevance is preserved; that is, each variable is valued with the level of 
precision required. Another advantage is that it addresses the problem of integrating the 
representation of existing uncertainty within group decision-making problems (Forbus 
1984). 

With respect to the above, assessing alternatives via linguistic information in the 
form of qualitative labels is performed easily and decision-making problems can be 
solved by means of these three main actions: the choice of the linguistic term set with 
its semantic value, the choice of the aggregation operator to deal with linguistic 
information and, finally, the choice or ranking of the best alternatives according to the 
aggregation phase (Herrera & Herrera-Viedma, 2000).  

Agell et al. (2012) present a new approach based upon QR techniques for 
representing and synthesizing the information given by a group of evaluators. A 
mathematical formulation is developed that contributes to decision analysis in the 
context of multi-criteria and group decision-making for ranking problems. The method 
used for ranking alternatives is based on comparing distances against a single optimal 
reference point which is modified in our proposed methodology, to capture the idea of 
TOPSIS methodology according to best and worst reference points. To do so, the 
proposed qualitative TOPSIS methodology and different steps of algorithm description 
are presented in the following section. 

3. Proposed qualitative TOPSIS methodology 

In this section the extension of the QR approach introduced in Agell et al. (2012) is 
considered together with TOPSIS decision-making methodology. TOPSIS, developed 
by Hwang and Yoon in 1981, is one of the MCDA techniques used to rank alternatives. 
The basic idea in TOPSIS that is used in this paper is that the compromise solution has 
the shortest distance to the positive “ideal” and the farthest distance from  “negative 
ideal” solution (Hwang & Yoon, 1981). It is particularly useful for those problems in 
which the valuations of the alternatives on the basis of the criteria are not represented in 
the same units (Cables, García-Cascales, & Lamata, 2012). 

Regarding Section 1, QR techniques manage data in terms of absolute order-of-
magnitude qualitative labels corresponding to different intervals. When considering 
linguistic rather than numerical valuations, a qualitative operation is needed to rank 
alternatives. Our proposed methodology is presented the linguistic extension of TOPSIS 
multi-criteria method to with qualitative labels. The proposed qualitative TOPSIS 
algorithm description for linguistic variables is detailed in the following steps: 

(1) Let us consider a set of possible alternatives 𝐴 =  {𝐴1, … ,𝐴𝑠}   and a set of 
criteria 𝐶 =  {𝐶1, … ,𝐶𝑚}  together with their weights defined by 𝑤𝑗 such that 
∑ wj = 1
𝑚
𝑗=1 . The assessment of alternatives with respect to criteria provides the 

decision matrix. 



(2) Each alternative is represented by a k-dimensional vector of qualitative labels, 
being k = r·m, where r and m are the number of experts and the number of 
criteria, respectively.  
The expert’s evaluations are given through a set of qualitative labels belonging 
to certain absolute order-of-magnitude spaces. The basic qualitative labels, 
corresponding to linguistic terms, are usually defined via a discretization given 
by a set {𝑎1, … ,𝑎𝑛+1} of real numbers 𝑎1 < ⋯ < 𝑎𝑛+1,  𝐵𝑖 =  [𝑎𝑖,𝑎𝑖+1]  𝑖 =
1, … ,𝑛. The non-basic qualitative labels, describing different levels of precision, 
are defined by   [𝐵𝑖,   𝐵𝑗] =  �𝑎𝑖,   𝑎𝑗+1�, 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, … ,𝑛, with i < 𝑗, 
considering    [𝐵𝑖,   𝐵𝑖] =   𝐵𝑖. 

(3) A measure µ is defined over the set of basic labels. Then, the location function 
value of each qualitative label  [ 𝐵𝑖,   𝐵𝑗] is introduced as an element in ℝ2 
whose first component is the opposite of the addition of the measures of the 
basic labels to the left of [𝐵𝑖,𝐵𝑗] and whose second component is the addition of 
the measures of the basic labels to its right (Eq. 1): 

 (1)    l ��𝐵𝑖,𝐵𝑗�� = �−∑ 𝜇(𝐵𝑠)𝑖−1𝑠=1 ,∑ 𝜇(𝐵𝑠)
𝑛
𝑠=𝑗+1 �  

(4) The location function is applied to each component of the k-dimensional vector 
of labels representing an alternative. Therefore, each alternative is codified via a 
vector in ℝ2𝑘. The reference labels to compute distances are, respectively, the 
minimum reference label, which is the vector 𝐴− = (𝐵1, … ,𝐵1) ∈ ℝ2, and the 
maximum reference label, which is the vector 𝐴∗ = (𝐵𝑛, … ,𝐵𝑛) ∈ ℝ2. Their 
location function values are as follows (Eq. 2 and Eq. 3): 

(2)  𝐿(𝐴−)  = (0 ,∑ 𝜇(𝐵𝑠)𝑛𝑠=2 , … , 0 ,∑ 𝜇(𝐵𝑠))
𝑛
𝑠=2   

(3)   𝐿(𝐴∗)  = (−∑ 𝜇(𝐵𝑠)𝑛−1𝑠=1 , 0, … ,−∑ 𝜇(𝐵𝑠)
𝑛−1
𝑠=1 , 0)   

(5) Then it can be integrated with TOPSIS to compute the weighted Euclidean 
distances of each alternative location to  𝐴∗ and  𝐴−  locations (Eq. 4). 

(4)   𝑑(𝑋,𝑌) = �∑ 𝑤𝑗 �∑ � 𝑋𝑘𝑗–𝑌𝑘𝑗�
22𝑟

𝑘=1 �
𝑚
𝑗=1 

(6) The qualitative closeness coefficient (𝑄𝐶𝐶𝑖) of each alternative is obtained by 
Eq. 5  

(5)  𝑄𝐶𝐶𝑖 =
𝑑𝑖
−

𝑑𝑖
∗+𝑑𝑖

− ,      𝑖 = 1,2 … ,𝑚.  

where 𝑑𝑖
∗ is the distance between 𝐿(𝐴𝑖) and 𝐿(𝐴∗) location functions, meanwhile 

𝑑𝑖
− is the distance between 𝐿(𝐴𝑖) and 𝐿(𝐴−) location functions. Finally, the 

alternatives are ranked by the decreasing order of 𝑄𝐶𝐶𝑖 values. 
 
Note that in qualitative TOPSIS algorithm, when utilizing linguistic terms the 

previous normalization of the weighted matrix is not necessary. 



3.1. An application to the wind farm location problem in Catalonia 

A case of wind farm location problem in Catalonia (northeast of Spain) (Gamboa & 
Munda, 2007), in a region between the counties of Urgell and Conca de Barberà, is 
used to illustrate the potential of the proposed method in Section 3 (see Figure 2).  

Figure. 2. Urgell and Conca de Barberà counties and technical feasibility zones 

 
The rapid development in wind energy technology has led to it being considered 

promising alternative to conventional energy systems. It is argued that wind energy, 
being  a powerful source of renewable energy with rapid and simple installation, lack of 
emissions and low water consumption, is one of the most promising tools for 
confronting global warming (Aras et al., 2004). Nevertheless, wind farm location is a 
problem that involves multiple and conflicting factors related to public opinion and 
public interest. To find the best wind farm location, the relevant economic, social, 
technical and environmental perspectives must be taken into account, as well as the 
decision-making process to reach a decision. Some studies have examined these key 
factors ( Lee, Chen, & Kang, 2009; Wolsink, 2010; Yeh & Huang, 2014). 

Considering the two preliminary alternatives corresponding to Coma Bertran 
and Serra del Tallat projects, other alternatives were generated based on the 
technological and economic feasibility, and acceptance of some social actors involving 
in this project (considering the worry of some people about the visual impact of the 
wind farms). Table 1 indicates the different alternatives that were finally proposed for 
the location of the desired wind farms. Two modified projects L and R consider the 
reduction of visual impact of the original proposals.

population centers and potential tourist attractions (Santuari del Tallat). 
R: This option attempts to move the windmills away from population centers presenting  
higher  resistance to the wind farms (Senan and Montblanc) 
NP: the possibility of constructing no project at all. 



 
These alternatives are evaluated on the basis of nine indicators which are 

defined by combining information from participatory processes, interviews and a review 
of the projects performed by the research group (see Table 2). Note that in this study, 
equal weights for indicators are considered.

3.2. Results 

The criteria scores were computed to construct the multi-criteria impact matrix. Table 3 
presents the impact matrix of the problem we are dealing with. The criteria scores are 
obtained from the study of Gamboa & Munda (2007). These scores must be aggregated 
by means of the proposed algorithm to achieve the final ranking of the alternatives.

To this end, the steps of the qualitative TOPSIS algorithm, detailed in Section 3, 
are executed. The highest and lowest scores of each criterion are respectively 
considered, in this case, as the maximum and minimum elements of the qualitative 
space, and therefore as reference labels. The first step of this algorithm is assigning 
qualitative labels to the quantitative scores to simplify the computation in the process of 
ranking. Table 4 shows these qualitative labels together with their locations, obtained 
directly from Eq. 1 where the considered measure µ over the set of basic labels is  μ(𝐵𝑖) 
= 1, for all i= 1,…,7. The qualitative TOPSIS approach considered in this example uses 
seven basic qualitative labels for each criterion. The basic qualitative labels correspond 
to seven intervals defined from minimum and the maximum values of the corresponding 
raw scores in Table 3 and their lengths, which are one seventh of the distance between 
these two values. For instance, land owner`s income indicator has the same label (B4) in 
projects L and R, because both of them stand on the same interval B4. In the same way, 
the rest of labels are provided to construct the qualitative impact matrix (Table 5).

Each alternative (A) is represented by a 9-dimensional vector of qualitative 
labels A = (C1, … , C9), obtained from assessment of indicators (C).  
As mentioned in Section 3, each label is represented via a vector in ℝ2k. Therefore, the 
location function L(A) codifies each alternative by an 18-dimensional vector of real 
numbers representing the position of the vector A, L(A) = ( X1, … , X18).   

Table 6 shows the alternative evaluation matrices via the locations of the nine 
indicators. The two vectors L(A−) = L(B1, … , B1) = (0,6, … ,0,6) and 
L(A∗) = L(B7, … , B7) = (−6,0, … ,−6,0) are considered as reference labels to compute 
distances (worst and best options).

Installed capacity (-1,5) (-1,5) (-4,2) (-6,0) (-3,3) (-3,3) (0,6) 

Then, the weighted Euclidean distance of each alternative from the two 
reference labels is calculated by means of Eq. 6. 

(6) 𝑑(𝐴, �̃�) = �∑ 𝑤𝑖( 𝑋𝑗–𝑋𝚥� )2)9𝑗=1  

The considered weights in this case are equal and the procedure detailed in 
Section 3 was applied. Table 7 shows the values of the distances to the reference labels 
of each alternative together with the values of the QCCi.

4. Comparison of the qualitative TOPSIS and a Condorcet based method 

There are many multi-criteria models that can be used to obtain a ranking of the 
available alternatives (Polatidis, Haralambopoulos, Munda, & Vreeker, 2006; Roy & 
Słowiński, 2013). Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. The reason 
for selecting the C-K-Y-L method for this comparison is its simple adaptation for social 
choice and sustainability issues. In addition, in this method a weakness of criteria is not 
compensated by strength of other desirable criteria, and using non-compensatory 
models in a social framework helps preserve all social actors’ opinions. We assume this 
method can be further enhanced via combining it with QR methods. Let us first 
introduce the C-K-Y-L method briefly in the following subsection and then compare 
both the advantages and drawbacks of two methods applied to the wind farm location 
problem.  

4.1. C-K-Y-L outranking method  

The C-K-Y-L method was presented as a combination of the original Condorcet 
approach  and the future attempts of  Kemeny, Young and Levenglick (Young & 
Levenglick, 1978) in the study of social framework by Munda (2005). This model 
integrates social, economic and technical factors inside a coherent framework and is a 
powerful model for energy policy analysis. The underlying idea for the development of 
this method was to enrich the dominance relation by some elements based on preference 
aggregation. In the C-K-Y-L method, the decision maker compares two alternatives 
according to preferences and indifferences between them (expressed by indifference and 
preference thresholds defined for each criterion) (Eq. 7). 

(7)  𝑎𝑗𝑃𝑎𝑘 ⟺ 𝑔𝑚�𝑎𝑗� >  𝑔𝑚(𝑎𝑘) + 𝑞 

         𝑎𝑗𝐼𝑎𝑘 ⟺ �𝑔𝑚�𝑎𝑗� −  𝑔𝑚(𝑎𝑘)�𝑞 

where P and I indicate a “preference” and an “indifference” relation, 
respectively and q is the positive indifference threshold. It means a higher value of 
criterion score is preferred to lower one (when criterion is for maximizing) and the same 
scores indicate an indifference relation when the difference between criteria is no more 
than the threshold. The maximum likelihood ranking of N alternatives is the ranking 
supported by the maximum number of criteria for each pair-wise comparison, summed 
over all pairs of alternatives considered. The outranking matrix composed by N (N-1) 
pair-wise comparisons between alternatives. By means of a pair-wise comparison 



between alternative j and k, an outranking matrix with elements 𝑒𝑗𝑘 is constructed using 
Eq. 8: 

 (8)  𝑒𝑗𝑘 = � �𝑤𝑚�𝑃𝑗𝑘� +
1
2
𝑤𝑚�𝐼𝑗𝑘��

𝑀

𝑚=1
   

where 𝑤𝑚 indicates the weight of each criterion. Considering that there are N! 
possible complete rankings of alternatives, the corresponding score φs is computed for 
each one of them and the final ranking is the one that maximizes φs (Eq. 9). 

(9)   φs = ∑ ejk               j ≠ k, s = 1,2, … N!  and ejk ∈ es  

4.2. Results Comparison  

In this section, qualitative TOPSIS is compared with C-K-Y-L methodology, not only 
comparing the results obtained by both methodologies but also comparing their main 
theoretical features.  

The results provided by the C-K-Y-L method in Gamboa & Munda (2007) 
present the five best rankings with the maximum score among all 5040 possible 
rankings according to the seven alternatives (see Table 8).

To sum up, Table 9 shows the final ranking produced by qualitative TOPSIS 

together with the first ranking obtained by applying the C-K-Y-L method.

As shown in Table 9, the differences of rankings occurred in the case of the NP 
option. In the proposed qualitative TOPSIS method, the option of No Project is not 
considered as a worst option because it depends on the distance of this alternative from 
the best and worst scores. So, the intensity of preferences is considered. In contrast,  
C-K-Y-L method does not consider this intensity and this alternative always loses in the 
pair-wise comparison against all the others. Also, the qualitative TOPSIS constructs 
only one ranking, whereas C-K-Y-L explores all N! possible Rankings, which represent 
different social actors’ preferences. 

 Although these two methods have produced similar rankings, they have 
different characteristics in the structure of aggregation procedures. The qualitative 
TOPSIS method does not require the handling of the previous discretization or 
definition of landmarks to define initial qualitative terms because the calculations are 
performed directly with the labels; the computations are very fast and easy. This method 
considers the intensity of preferences. In contrast, the C-K-Y-L method uses a 



maximum likelihood approach as an aggregation function, which makes it more 
difficult to compute; in fact, and it becomes unmanageable as the number of alternatives 
rises.  

Additionally, the qualitative TOPSIS method can address different levels of 
precision, from the basic labels representing the most precise ones to the least precise 
label which can be used to represent unknown values. This strength of the proposed 
method has not been used in this real example with given evaluation scores. On the 
other hand, C-K-Y-L avoids compensation and trade-offs by representing the weights as 
the importance coefficients. Therefore, low scores on one criterion cannot be 
compensated by high scores on another. Table 10 shows the main characteristics of both 
methodologies. 
Table 10. Comparison of both ranking methodologies

Compensatory Compensatory Model Non-Compensatory Model 
Weights Trade-off Importance coefficients

minimum 
Maximum likelihood approach 

These differences suggest that both methods could be used together 
synergistically. For instance the qualitative TOPSIS can more efficiently to process data 
when it is qualitative from the beginning; meanwhile C-K-Y-L can enforce the absence 
of compensation.   

5. Conclusion 

Generally, the variables which are defined by words or sentences rather than numbers in 
a natural or artificial language are called linguistic variables. These variables can be 
used to assess alternatives under uncertainty. Techniques based on order-of-magnitude 
QR have provided theoretical models that can obtain results from non-numeric 
variables.  

This paper introduces a MCDA application to wind farm location selection 
based on a qualitative TOPSIS methodology. This method takes into account intensity 
of preferences and gives experts the ability to assess alternatives under uncertainty. In 
addition, in the case of providing data from expert’s preferences, it enables them to 
express their preferences with an appropriate degree of precision (from the absolute to 
unknown opinions). This is a desirable feature in order to consider transparent decision 
processes. The results are compared with C-K-Y-L methodology based on outranking. 
This approach is strongly recognized from a sustainability point of view as a non-
compensatory method. This method does not take the intensity of preferences into 
account; however, one of its advantages is that it pays attention to the important issue 
that a social or environmental disaster cannot be compensated with another criterion 
such as economic success.  

In future research the integration of both methods will be considered. On the one 
hand, the use of non-compensatory methods is considered very useful in sustainability 
problems as mentioned above. On the other hand, the use of qualitative labels 
determined by a partition of the real line, introduced in QR, is considered to provide an 
appropriate evaluation framework for group decision-making under uncertainty. In 



future research new real cases will be considered to apply the proposed method using 
different levels of precision in alternative assessments.
