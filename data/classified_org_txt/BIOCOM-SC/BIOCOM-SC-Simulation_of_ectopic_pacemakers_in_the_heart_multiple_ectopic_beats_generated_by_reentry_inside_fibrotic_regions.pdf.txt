The inclusion of nonconducting media, mimicking cardiac fibrosis, in two models of cardiac tissue produces the formation of
ectopic beats. The fraction of nonconducting media in comparison with the fraction of healthy myocytes and the topological
distribution of cells determines the probability of ectopic beat generation. First, a detailed subcellular microscopic model that
accounts for the microstructure of the cardiac tissue is constructed and employed for the numerical simulation of action potential
propagation. Next, an equivalent discrete model is implemented, which permits a faster integration of the equations. This discrete
model is a simplified version of the microscopic model that maintains the distribution of connections between cells. Both models
produce similar results when describing action potential propagation in homogeneous tissue; however, they slightly differ in the
generation of ectopic beats in heterogeneous tissue. Nevertheless, both models present the generation of reentry inside fibrotic
tissues. This kind of reentry restricted to microfibrosis regions can result in the formation of ectopic pacemakers, that is, regions
that will generate a series of ectopic stimulus at a fast pacing rate. In turn, such activity has been related to trigger fibrillation in the
atria and in the ventricles in clinical and animal studies.

1. Introduction

Cardiac arrhythmias are malfunctions of the coordinated
dynamics of heart electric activity. In the extreme case when
many cardiac myocytes are strongly desynchronized, con-
traction is impaired.This underlying complex spatiotemporal
dynamics is called fibrillation and can take place in the
atria or ventricles. Reentry that is the reappearance of the
action potential wave after its first passage or spiral wave is
believed to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for
fibrillation. Once one or more spiral waves exist, they can
interact or a single one can become unstable and in either
situation this may lead to fibrillation. Spiral generation, spiral
breakup, instabilities, and fibrillation have been extensively
studied by the use of computational models [1–3], clinical
data, or animal models [4–7]. One of the most common
protocols to generate a spiral wave is via an ectopic beat:
an additional stimulus generates a second wave that will

interact with the sinus wave and lead to the genesis of a spiral
wave or reentry. This process is well understood and many
known situations lead to the appearance of an ectopic beat in
pathological or physiological conditions. Just to name two of
them, in a healthy heart, an external impactmay stretch some
region of the heart and via stretch-activated ion channels,
cardiacmyocytesmay coordinately generate action potentials
that may initiate a second wave [8]. In an infarct region, gap
junctional remodeling, fibroblast to myocyte coupling, and
fibrosis can significantly slow down wave propagation when
it enters the infarct region, so that the wave leaves the region
detached from the sinus wave, that is, when a second wave or
ectopic beat appears [9].

There are many different protocols for the generation
of fibrillation. Fast pacing is a common protocol used in
both computational and animal models and experiments
[5, 6, 10]. We can refer to a recent work [11] where atrial
fibrillation was studied in an accurate model of human atria.

In the mentioned work, it was only possible to induce atrial
fibrillation by using a burst of at least six consecutive ectopic
beats separated by 130ms or via continuous fast periodic
pacing (also with an ectopic beat period of 130ms). Unfor-
tunately, differently from the case of a single ectopic beat,
there are notmanywell-understood examples or explanations
for ectopic pacemakers that is a region that would generate
multiple ectopic beats at a frequency much higher (near an
order of magnitude) than the sinus rhythm. In particular,
new evidences suggest that two mechanisms (combined or
not) may play a very important role in the generation of
ectopic pacemakers: abnormal intracellular calcium (Ca2+)
signalling and microreentry (reentry inside a fibrotic region)
[12].

In this work we were able to generate an ectopic pace-
maker in computer simulations of cardiac electrophysiology
by assuming a single hypothesis for substrate: the existence of
a region with a mixture of excitable (healthy myocytes) and
nonexcitable (fibrosis, for instance) areas, where each area
has a minimum size of a single myocyte. This fibrotic region
has been named before as microfibrosis [13–15], not mainly
because of its whole size, but rather due to the microscopic
separation of these two phases, myocytes and fibrosis, which
as mentioned before is at the scale of a single myocyte.

The mechanism of this ectopic pacemaker is simple. The
two different phases (excitable and nonexcitable) form amaze
or labyrinth for wave propagation. Propagation becomes
fractionated by the zig-zag like or tortuous pathways it has
to follow. Macroscopic propagation is considerably slowed
down. Microscopically, the topology of the maze allows the
electric wave to reexcite the fibrotic tissue before the wave
leaves it.Therefore, reentry and spiral waves are formed inside
the fibrotic region.This spiral-like wave will continuously try
to generate ectopic beats whenever it touches the border of
the fibrotic region.

Evidences that support this thesis can be found in previ-
ous computational, animal, and clinical studies. Many animal
studies have associated regions near fibrosis as triggers for
ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation [9], or atrial fibrillation
[16]. Macroscopically, it has been shown that propagation
velocity in the border zone of infarct may drop from 0.51m/s
to 0.09m/s [9].Microscopically, propagation near fibrosis has
been associated with fractionated electrograms, or complex
fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE), in both animal [17]
and clinical studies [18]. These findings have remarkably
changed the management and prognostics of patients with
atrial fibrillation via a new procedure of catheter ablation of
atrial fibrillation that is guided byCFAEmapping [19]. Recent
clinical studies of guided CFAE ablation revisited the benefits
and risks of this procedure and clearly suggest that further
investigation on this topic is required [20–22].

Computer simulations gave valuable insights into how the
microstructure of cardiac tissue, specifically microfibrosis,
and CFAEs are related [13, 15]. These previous studies have
used realist electrophysiology single myocyte models and
detailed microscopic description to quantitatively represent
the fine structure of cardiac tissue; that is, the models were
based on subcellular discretizations of cardiac tissue.

Figure 1: In the center of this figure we present the fibrotic region
that is simulated in this work. The presence of reentry inside the
fibrotic region may constantly reexcite the surrounding tissue and
therefore act as an ectopic pacemaker.

However, up to now, a clear link between the microstruc-
ture remodeling of cardiac tissue (microfibrosis) and a the-
oretical substrate for cardiac arrhythmia (fibrillation) is still
missing. Evidences of the importance of tissue heterogeneity,
specifically of nonconductive cells, on spiral genesis and
breakup were already presented in a theoretical study using
simple models based on cellular automata [23]. Recently,
Alonso and Bär [24] have presented, for the first time,
simulations based on simple discrete and isotropic models
of cardiac tissue that could generate ectopic pacemakers.
The mechanism was the one explained before: reentry was
generated inside a heterogeneous tissue (composed of active
or nonactive discrete cells). In addition, Alonso and Bär [24]
have described how the probability of reentry depends on a
specific feature of the topology of the discrete network that
was used to model cardiac tissue: the percentage of nonactive
cells phi.

The focus of this work is on bridging the gap between
the quantitative and more complex models used to simu-
late microfibrosis and CFAEs [13] and the qualitative and
simplified models used to relate microfibrosis and ectopic
pacemaker [24]. For this purpose two different models were
used, and both are as complex and realistic as those used
before in [13]; that is, both use realistic description of single
myocyte electrophysiology and account for the microstruc-
ture of cardiac tissue such as gap junction distribution and
tissue anisotropy: (1) a microscopic model with subcellular
discretization of 8 𝜇m as described before in [25] and (2) a
discrete equivalent model that, to the best of our knowledge,
has never been presented before. It is important to highlight
that in this paper our models focus on the electric dynamics
inside the ectopic pacemaker or microfibrosis region (see
Figure 1). In the near future we will study how this activity
propagates to the outside of this fibrotic region and ultimately
influence the surrounding (nonfibrotic) regions of the heart.

Our simulation results support the thesis that the
microstructure of a fibrotic tissue may indeed generate per se

an ectopic pacemaker via reentry inside the microfibrosis.
Also, as in [24], the probability of a fibrotic region to become
an ectopic pacemaker depends on the percentage of fibrosis
in the tissue. Using our realistic models we could quantify
that ectopic pacemakers were easier to be generated with 𝜙
between 42% and 50%. Our results also gave new insights
and suggest that, in addition to the percentage of fibrosis,
𝜙, the probability of a fibrotic region to become an ectopic
pacemaker also depends on the direction of the approaching
plane wave. This is in agreement with the recent results
presented in [15] where it was shown that the waveforms
of CFAEs depend on both the structure or topology of the
fibrosis and the direction of the approaching propagating
wave.

2. Methods

2.1. A Detailed Microscopic Model of Mouse Ventricular Tissue

2.1.1. Modeling Cardiac Microstructure. We developed a two-
dimensional model that is based on the previous work
of Spach and collaborators [26, 27] that accounts for the
microstructure of cardiac tissue, gap junction heterogeneous
distribution, and discretizations of 8 𝜇m × 8 𝜇m. A basic
template for myocyte connections was developed and is
presented in Figure 2(b). This basic unit accounts for the
connection of a total of 32 cardiac myocytes with different
shapes and numbers of neighboring cells.

In the previous model of Spach and collaborators [26,
27] the basic template consisted of 33 myocytes with

a discretization of 10 𝜇m × 10 𝜇m whereas in our template
we have 32 myocytes with a discretization of 8 𝜇m × 8 𝜇m.
These small modifications to the original model proposed
in [26, 27] were adopted to better describe the values for
cell length and width reported in the recent literature. The
mean and SD (standard deviation) values for cell length and
width are 120.9 ± 27.8 𝜇m and 18.3 ± 3.5 𝜇m, respectively.
These values are close to those reported in the literature:
[28] (length = 140 𝜇m and width = 19𝜇m), [29] (length =
134 𝜇m and width = 18 𝜇m), and [30] (length = 100 𝜇m and
width = 17.32 𝜇m). On average each cell connects to the
other 6 neighboring myocytes. Our two-dimensional model
considers a homogeneous depth 𝑑 = 10 𝜇m [26, 27].

This basic unit was created in such a way that it allows the
generation of larger tissue preparations via the connections
of multiples instances of it. Figure 2(a) presents how this can
be achieved.

Figure 2(c) presents an example of how the connections
between different myocytes can be arranged. The code was
developed in a flexible way, so that it allows the user to set
up for each discretized volume Vol

𝑖,𝑗
(with area = ℎ × ℎ)

conductivity or conductance values for the north (𝜎
𝑥
𝑖,𝑗+1/2

),
south (𝜎

𝑖,𝑗−1/2

), west (𝜎
𝑥
𝑖−1/2,𝑗

), and east (𝜎
𝑥
𝑖+1/2,𝑗

) volume
faces. These can be any nonnegative values. In this work,
we set the discretization ℎ to 8𝜇m. In addition, based on
the work of Spach and collaborators [26, 27], we chose
only 5 possible types of connections between neighboring
volumes that are membrane (𝜎

𝑚
= 0.0), cytoplasm (𝜎

𝑐
=

0.4 𝜇S/𝜇m), gap junction plicate (𝐺
𝑝
= 0.5 𝜇S), intriplicate



4 BioMed Research International

(𝐺
𝑖
= 0.33 𝜇S), and combined plicate (𝐺

𝑐
= 0.062 𝜇S), where

we use 𝜎 for conductivity and 𝐺 for conductance. For the
simulations presented in this work, the distribution of the
different gap junctions within the 32 myocytes was not
randomly generated. Instead, the gap junction distribution
of the basic template unit was manually chosen to reproduce
the distribution presented before in [26, 27]. With this
setup and conductivity values we found that conduction
velocity along the fibers was around 410 𝜇m/ms (LP) and was
130 𝜇m/ms transversal to fiber direction (TP). This results in
a ratio LP/TP of 0.32, which is close to the conduction ratio
reported in [26]. It is worth mentioning that the values of
longitudinal and transversal conduction velocities observed
in experiments vary significantly (longitudinal conduction
velocity is between 30 and 70 cm/s under normal or control
conditions). Indeed, this large variation of measurements are
due tomany factors, such as the experimental technique used,
temperature, pacing protocol, species, and heart region. Our
value for LP conduction velocity (41 cm/s) is within the range
of those reported in the literature: rat left atria [31] (42 ±
17 cm/s), dog left ventricle [32] (63 ± 10 cm/s), mouse left and
right ventricle [33] (35 ± 3 cm/s), and guinea pig left and right
ventricle [34] (52 ± 2 cm/s).

2.1.2. The Heterogeneous Monodomain Model. Action poten-
tials propagate through the cardiac tissue because the intra-
cellular space of cardiac cells is electrically coupled by gap
junctions. In this work, we do not consider the effects of
the extracellular matrix. Therefore, the phenomenon can be
describedmathematically by a reaction-diffusion type partial
differential equation (PDE) calledmonodomainmodel, given
by

𝜕𝜂 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡)

𝜕𝑡

(1)

where 𝑉 is the variable of interest and represents the trans-
membrane voltage, that is, the difference between intracellu-
lar to extracellular potential; 𝜂 is a vector of state variables,
which also influence the generation and propagation of the
electric wave, and usually includes the intracellular concen-
tration of different ions (K+, Na+, Ca2+) and the permeability
of different membrane ion channels; 𝛽 is the surface-volume
ratio of heart cells; 𝐶

𝑚
is the membrane capacitance; 𝐼ion the

total ionic current, which is a function of 𝑉 and a vector
of state variables 𝜂; 𝐼stim is the current due to an external
stimulus; 𝜎 is the monodomain conductivity tensor. We
assume that the boundary of the tissue is isolated; that is, no-
flux boundary conditions were imposed (n ⋅𝜎∇𝑉 = 0 on 𝜕Ω).

In this work, the Bondarenko et al. model [35] that
describes the electrical activity of left ventricular cells of
mice was considered to simulate the kinetics of 𝐼ion in (1).
The Bondarenko et al. model (BDK) was the first model
presented for mouse ventricular myocytes [35]. The ionic
current term 𝐼ion in this model consists of the sum of 15

transmembrane currents. In short, Bondarenko’s model is
based on an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with 41
differential variables that control ionic currents and cellular
homeostasis. In this model most of the ion channels are
represented by Markov chains (MCs).

2.1.3. Numerical Discretization in Space and Time. The finite
volume method (FVM) is a mathematical method used to
obtain a discrete version of partial differential equations.This
method is suitable for numerical simulations of various types
of conservation laws (elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic) [36].
Like the finite element method (FEM), the FVM can be used
in several types of geometry, using structured or unstructured
meshes and generates robust numerical schemes.

The development of the method is intrinsically linked to
the concept of flow between regions or adjacent volumes;
that is, it is based on the numerical calculation of net fluxes
into or out of a control volume. For some isotropic problems
discretized with regular spatial meshes, the discretization
obtained with the FVM is very similar to the one obtained
with the standard finite difference method (FDM). Detailed
information about the FVM applied to the solution of
monodomain can be found in [37, 38].

The reaction and diffusion parts of the monodomain
equations were split by employing the Godunov operator
splitting [39]. Therefore, each time step involves the solution
of two different problems: a nonlinear system of ODEs

and a parabolic PDE

) = ∇ ⋅ (𝜎∇𝑉) . (3)

For the discretization of the nonlinear system of ODEs
we note that its stiffness demands very small time steps. For
simple models based on Hodgkin-Huxley formulation this
problem is normally overcomeby using theRush-Larsen (RL)
method [40]. However, for the most modern and complex
models that are highly based on MCs, the RL method
seems to be ineffective in terms of allowing larger time
steps during the numerical integration. For the case of the
Bondarenko et al. model, we tested both methods, Euler and
RL, and both demanded the same time step, Δ𝑡

𝑜
= 0.0001ms

due to stability issues. Since the RLmethod is more expensive
per time step than the Euler method, in this work, we used
the simple explicit Euler method for the discretization of the
nonlinear ODEs.

Since the spatial discretization of our model, ℎ, is
extremely small, the CFL [41] condition that assures numeri-
cal stability is very restrictive.Therefore, for the PDE we used
the unconditionally stable implicit Euler scheme. In addition
this allowed us to use a longer time step for the numerical
solution of the PDE (Δ𝑡

). The time derivative

first order implicit Euler scheme.

The diffusion term in (3) must be discretized in space.
For the space discretizationwe considered a two-dimensional
uniform mesh, consisting of regular quadrilaterals (called
“volumes”). Located in the center of each volume is a node.

2.2. An Equivalent Discrete Model of Mouse Ventricular Tissue

2.2.1. A Discrete Model. Recent studies on discrete or dis-
continuous nature of propagation of the action potential
have avoided the computational challenges that arise from
microscopic models, through the development and use of
discrete models, where each cardiac myocyte is represented
by a single point (cell) contact with neighboring myocytes

via discrete conductivities [24, 42]. This description has
enabled the study of the effects that random distributions
of conductivities have on conduction velocity and on the
formation of patterns of reentry in cardiac tissue.

Discrete models were introduced by Keener in [43] to
describe the electrical propagation in a 1D cable with nc cells
connected to the case of low coupling of gap junctions. In this
model, cells are considered isopotentials. Recently, in a work
of Costa and Dos Santos [44], a comparison between discrete
and microscopic models of a 1D cable of cells was presented.

In this work, an equivalent discrete model to the 2D
microscopic model presented in Section 2.1 was developed.
For this, using the cardiac microstructure presented in
Section 2.1 and identifying the neighbors (links) of each cell,
the conductance between each link was calculated and a new
equivalent discrete model was generated.

In the microscopic model we had a uniform two-
dimensional mesh consisting of regular quadrilaterals (called
volumes). For the discrete model, each myocyte is repre-
sented by a single node or cell of a network, and each cell has
different geometry (Vol

𝑖
= 𝐴
𝑖
∗ 𝑑) and a different number of

neighboring cells (nn
𝑖
). Figure 3 shows the resulting discrete

topology for a basic unit of our microscopic mesh.
The equations that govern the propagation of action

potentials in the cardiac tissue are similar to those used in
the microscopic model presented in Section 2.1:

The time discretization is done in the same way as in
the microscopic model (Section 2.1). As before, the reaction
and diffusion parts of the monodomain equations were split
by employing the Godunov operator splitting [39]. There-
fore, each time step involves the solution of two different

2.2.2. Calculation of the Conductance between Neighbor-
ing Cells. To close the description of the discrete model
presented in the previous section, we need to define the
conductance values of the connections; that is, we need the
values for 𝐺

𝑖,𝑗
in (8).

This is done by applying the concept of combination
of resistors in parallel to the microstructure defined in
Section 2.1.1 for each pair of neighboring cells. From the
association of resistors we have

contains the gap junction connection 𝑘 in cell 𝑖. It should
be noted that these coordinates are index integers of the
volumes in the mesh, so they do not have unit length. Thus

2.3. Modeling Thousands of Fibrotic Regions. The sophisti-
cated method presented in [15] to model fibrosis involves
a huge pipeline based on histology acquisition, image pro-
cessing, segmentation, and mesh generation. The purpose
of our work is to assess the probability of a certain fibrotic
tissue to become an ectopic pacemaker and to study how this
depends on the fraction of fibrosis, 𝜙. To achieve this goal it
is necessary to perform thousands of simulations of different
microfibrosismodels.Therefore, themethodpresented in [15]
does not fit to our purpose. We could, however, proceed with
our study by using a similar method as presented in [13].

For a given value of 𝜙, we randomly generate a microfi-
brosis tissue by transforming some of the myocytes of our
model in fibrosis, that is, nonconducting material. This was
performed by removing all the gap junctions of the chosen
myocytes, so that any propagation into or out of this myocyte
is blocked. One hundred of realizations of different microfi-
brosis but with the same percentage of nonactive cells, 𝜙,
were simulated. This process is represented by Figure 4. The
value of 𝜙 was varied from 40% to 55%, in steps of 1%. After
each microfibrosis model is created using the microscopic
model the equivalent discrete model is generated following
the procedure explained in Section 2.2. For all the results
presented in the next section the modeled cardiac tissues had
dimensions of 1 cm × 1 cm.

3. Results

We employ numerical simulations to compare the two mod-
els described in Section 2 under two different situations:
completely homogeneous distribution of healthy cells and

the randomly inclusion of nonconducting cells. First we
compare the dynamics of wave propagation and functional
reentry in both models under homogeneous conditions.
Then, we employ both models to study the problem of
anatomical reentry in heterogeneous cardiac tissue.

The main advantage of the discrete model is the fast
execution times when compared to those of the microscopic
model. As we will present in the next sections this will be
of extreme importance since we will present the simulations
of over three thousands of different microfibrosis models.
Table 1 compares the execution times of the parallel imple-
mentations of the microscopic versus the discrete models.
The simulations were executed on a parallel environment
composed of 64 CPU cores and 16 GPUs as previously
described in [25]. The parallel implementation and envi-
ronment were able to reduce the execution time of the
microscopic model from more than 6 days to 22 minutes. In
addition, the parallel implementation of the discrete model
takes only near one minute for the execution of the same
simulation.

3.1. Wave Propagation in HomogeneousModels of Cardiac Tis-
sue. In order to compare bothmodels, we performnumerical
simulations under homogeneous conditions and compare the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the action potential waves.

3.1.1. TravelingWaves inHomogeneousModels. The twomod-
els described in the previous section gives rise to equivalent
waves of action potential under the same conditions. For
a quantitative comparison see Figure 5. An initial centered
perturbation produces a concentric wave which propagates
to the border of the medium. Its elliptic shape is due to the
anisotropy of the tissue, which allows the wave to propagate
faster in the longitudinal direction (to the left or to the
right, see Figure 5) than in the vertical direction (bottom-
up). The good agreement in the qualitative comparison
between the snapshots at the same time shown at the top
of Figure 5 is confirmed by the quantitative measurement of
the action potential in a single cell of the tissue; see bottom
of Figure 5. Under homogeneous conditions both models
produce quantitatively the same types of waves because the
connectivities among cells are equivalent (see Section 2.2.2)
and, therefore, velocity of propagation is the same.

3.1.2. Functional Reentry in Homogeneous Models. The activ-
ity of the membrane action potential wave can remain in
the tissue if there is a reentry. This can be produced by

the S1-S2 protocol which consists in the reexcitation of the
tissue (ectopic beat) after the pass of a normal traveling wave
[25]. In Figure 6 an example of rotating spiral wave of action
potential in the microscopic model of the tissue is shown.
There is a repeated reexcitation of the tissue due to the reentry
of the spiral wave and its rotation around a free end.

The action potential measured in a single cell (marked
with a black square in the snapshots of the simulations)
is shown in the bottom part of Figure 6 and compared
with the equivalent simulation with the discrete model. The
agreement is remarkable taking into account the different
levels of approximation used by the two models. Thus,
complex dynamics is well captured by the discrete model in
comparison with the microscopic model.

3.2. Wave Propagation in Heterogeneous Models of Cardiac
Tissue. Further comparisons between both models for het-
erogeneous conditions at the tissue level are shown in the
next sections. Following, we remove a fraction of cells; that
is, we randomly choose some cells which are then completely
isolated from the rest of the tissue and cannot be excited
anymore. Such cells represent the effect of the different types
of heterogeneities in the tissue: damaged cells, damaged
connections, fibrosis, extracellular matrix, or dead cells. We
define as control parameter the fraction of isolated cells
𝜙; that is, 𝜙 = 0 corresponds to the homogeneous limit
discussed in the previous section and 𝜙 = 1 to a completely
inert piece of tissue.

3.2.1. Anatomical Reentry in the Discrete Model. In the dis-
crete model, for small fraction 𝜙 propagation is possible and
a wave can travel with a reduced velocity from one side of the
tissue to the other. For large value of 𝜙 there are no pathways
for the wave to propagate and the excitation disappears
without the activation of the tissue. For intermediate values
of 𝜙 the propagation looks fractionated but it is usually
still coherent and travels to the other side of the tissue.
However, depending on the random realization of the process
of isolation of cells, waves can be broken and it produces
the appearance of reentry into the already excited tissue;
see Figure 7. A wave of action potential propagates from
the left to the right in a tissue with a large fraction of
removed cells following the diverse open pathways in the
tissue. The propagation is highly fractionated but the wave
arrives to the end of the tissue. However, after the left-to-
right propagation, a piece of the wave reenters again into the
tissue already excited and produces the formation of repeated
reentry, equivalent to a spiral wave. The dynamics is stable
and the reentry persists for large times, although it could
eventually disappear depending on the random realization
[24]. Similar patterns of microscopic reentry can be found
also by initiating the propagation from the bottom of the
tissue; see Figure 8.

We have done a systematic study for the evaluation of
the optimal fraction 𝜙 where the probability of reentry is
maximal. We run 100 numerical simulations with different
random realization for each value of the fraction 𝜙. The value
of 𝜙was varied from 40% to 55%, in steps of 1%.This allowed

us to estimate for each value of 𝜙 the probability of reentry,
that is, the ratio of simulations with reentry to the total
number of simulations.

The results of these simulations are shown in Figure 9.
A reentry was identified whenever there was still activity
(depolarization) at 120ms after the initial stimulus for the
case of longitudinal propagation, or at 300ms for the case
of transversal propagation. Therefore, here we did not make
any difference between sustained or nonsustained reentries.
The values of 120 and 300ms were chosen by checking that
a plane wave reaches the end of the tissue for the case of
𝜙 = 0.45 after 60ms (240ms) for longitudinal (transverse)
propagation. Therefore, in both cases, we checked whether
there was still activity 60ms after the wave was already
supposed to be extinguished.

Figure 9 shows a systematic difference of the results
depending on the directions of propagation of the waves.
In the LP direction the probability of reentry concentrates
around 𝜙 = 0.48; however, when waves propagate trans-
versely to the fiber direction (TP) the domain of reentry
is broader and the distribution is flatter and above 10% for

𝜙 between 0.42 and 0.48. Nevertheless, in both cases, the
probability of reentry goes to zero shortly after 𝜙 ∼ 0.5; see
Figure 9.

3.2.2. Anatomical Reentry in the Microscopic Model. The
numerical simulations using the microscopic model take
much longer execution times than those based on the discrete
model. The realization of good statistics with such model
becomes a very hard task. For this reason, we have chosen
the topologies from some selected simulations in the discrete
model and implemented them in the microscopic model to
compare the results of both models.

We first chose 30 topologies that did not generate reentry
in the discrete model, but those were under values of the
fraction 𝜙 of high probability of reentry. We observed that
none of these simulations using the fine microscopic model
gave rise to the appearance of any reentry. Therefore, in this
case there was a 100% of match between the two models.

We have also performed 30 (15 TP plus 15 LP simulations)
realizations selecting topologies which produced reentry in
the discrete model. For the LP case, 15 simulations were

executed, five for each value of 𝜙 = {0.45, 0.48, 0.51}. For the
TP case, 15 simulations were also executed, five for each value
of 𝜙 = {0.42, 0.45, 0.48}. Therefore, for both cases we took
the value of 𝜙 that maximizes the probability of reentry, and
two values of 𝜙 around this value but with low probability of
reentry; see Figure 9.

While 19 realizations out of 30 gave rise to reentry, 11
realizations did not show any reentry. It produces a 63%
of agreement between the two models in the prediction of
reentries once the reentry appears in the discrete model.
These results are shown in Figure 10.The five cases of reentry
in the discrete model for each value of 𝜙 reduce to 2–4
reentries in the microscopic model.

An example for a case of agreement between the two
models is shown in Figure 11. The comparison between
the microscopic ((a)-(c)) and the discrete ((b)-(d)) model
produces a qualitative agreement in the propagation of the
wave and in the localization of the reentry, although the
reentrant waves are different in shape.

On the other hand, some realizations using the same
topologies for bothmodels gave rise to different final dynam-
ics. Figure 12 shows the comparison between two simulations

with the two models. While we observe a reentry in the
discrete model no reentry is observed in the simulation with
the microscopic model. The wave initially propagates in the
two models following a very similar dynamics; however,
later on the simulation, propagation stops in the microscopic
model, whereas in the discrete model it persists as a reentry
wave.

To further investigate these differences between micro-
scopic and discrete results, we have performed another set of
simulations.We have simulated two different fibrotic regions,
both with 𝜙 = 0.48, with longitudinal stimulation (left-right)
for the duration of 400ms, and another two different fibrotic
regions, both with 𝜙 = 0.45, with transversal stimulation
(bottom-up) for the duration of 800ms. These four new
scenarios were simulated with both discrete and microscopic
models, that is, a total of 8 simulations. Tables 2 and 3 present
the results of this comparison. For each cell (discrete model)
or discretized volume (microscopic model) we classified
the electrical activity observed during the simulations as
NA (no activity), A (a single AP, no reentry), S (sustained
reentry, multiple APs until the end of the simulation), or NS
(nonsustained reentry, multiple APs, but activity stops, dies

case ofNS activity we have alsomeasured the time the reentry
died out. Table 2 (left-right simulations) andTable 3 (bottom-
up simulations) present the percentage of tissue classified as
NA, A, S, and NS. We observe a very good match between
the results of the discrete and the microscopic models for
three out of the four cases studied (both in terms of the
classification and the duration of the reentry for the NS case).

However, for one particular case (Run 1, Table 2) the discrete
model overestimates the area of the tissue that sustains
reentry (near one third of the tissue) in comparison to the
area where reentry is sustained using the microscopic model
(only one fifth of the tissue).

4. Discussion

4.1. Bridging the Gap between Ectopic Pacemakers Formation
and CFAEs in Microfibrosis. Our simulation results present
the generation of reentry inside fibrotic tissues. This kind of
reentry restricted to microfibrosis regions can result in the
formation of ectopic pacemakers, that is, regions that will
generate a series of ectopic stimulus at a fast pacing rate. In
turn, such activity has been related to trigger fibrillation, both
in the atria and in the ventricles in clinical and animal studies
[5, 6, 10].

In addition, our results quantitatively described how the
percentage of fibrosis (𝜙) influences the probability of a
region to become an ectopic pacemaker. Reentry activity
inside a fibrotic region was identified in cardiac tissues with
a percentage of fibrosis (or nonconductingmaterial) between
41% and 52%; see Figure 9. It is interesting to mention that
[45] reports that in postmortem atrial tissues from patients
who died of cardiovascular causes, the extent of fibrosis was
strongly correlated with the history of atrial fibrilation (AF).
The mentioned work highlights this correlation presenting
three histologies: (1) with a fibrosis extent of 51% of the
tissue from a patient with a history of permanent AF; (2)
with a fibrosis extent of 14% from a patient with a history
of paroxysmal AF; (3) with a fibrosis extent of 5% from
a patient with no history of AF. These numbers are in

agreement with our findings. Our results suggests that with
less than 40% of fibrosis the conduction velocity of the prop-
agating wave can be substantially reduced but without the
generation of reentry inside the fibrotic region. This pattern
could potentially generate a single ectopic beat, enough for
paroxysmal AF. For permanent or sustained AF, the work of

[11] suggest the need for an ectopic pacemaker. And indeed
the fibrosis extent of 51% reported in [45] and associated with
permanent AF is within our predicted values of 𝜙 (between
41% and 52%) that has led to the generation of reentry inside
the fibrotic region, that is to the formation of an ectopic
pacemaker.

Figure 12: Reentry ((b)-(d)) and nonreentry ((a)-(c)) of action potential generated by the heterogeneous structure of the tissue in the
microscopic ((a)-(c)) and the discrete ((b)-(d)) model. ((a)-(b)) Wave rapidly propagates to the right following the direction of the fibers
in the microscopic (a) and in the discrete model (b), for 𝑡 = 40ms. The wave does not reenter into the tissue in the microscopic model (c),
for 𝑡 = 100ms. A piece of the wave reenters into the tissue in the discrete model (d), for 𝑡 = 100ms.

Finally, the computational models used here are very
similar to those used in [13] that also simulated microfibrosis
with the focus on the study of CFAEs [13]. In [13] it was
shown that decoupling of myocytes or increase of fibrosis
extent was associated with complex pattern of propagation,
discrete propagation, and CFAEs. Since we have studied
the generation of ectopic pacemakers with a very similar
formalism as used in [13], we have a clear theoretical evidence
that brings together ectopic pacemakers and CFAEs for the
case of propagation in fibrotic tissues. The results presented
here and the new models developed in this work may help in
the translational and extremely complex task of relating basic
electrophysiological and structural features of cardiac tissue
to clinical and relevant procedures such as catheter ablation
of atrial fibrillation guided by CFAE mapping [19].

4.2. Extending the Percolation Threshold for Anisotropic Car-
diac Tissue. The maximum in the probability of reentry has
been previously associated with the percolation threshold
of the network or topology of the tissue [24]. Here, as
already mentioned, the average number of first neighbors of

the network (see Figure 3(b)) is around 6 and the topological
structure of the cell network is similar to an hexagonal
network, whose percolation threshold is 𝜙 = 0.5. However,
the network used here is not exactly hexagonal and represents
an anisotropic tissue. The anisotropic conduction does not
only elongates the symmetric view in one direction but also
modifies the distribution of the first neighbors. As a result,
the percolation threshold changes. In addition, as suggested
by the results of Figure 9, it is likely that the percolation
threshold not only depends on the topology of the network
or tissue but also on the direction of the propagating wave.
To verify this hypothesis, we have numerically calculated the
probability of connection between two opposing sides of the
tissue, 𝐶(𝜙), using the same method as proposed in [24], for
the two different propagating directions, TP and LP. Figure 13
presents the results for the probability of connection, 𝐶(𝜙),
for the two cases, TP and LP. From these two distributions we
can obtain that in the LP direction the percolation threshold
is 𝜙 = 0.527, whereas for the TP direction it is 𝜙 = 0.47.

Therefore, we conclude that the percolation threshold for
anisotropic cardiac tissue depends not only on the topology

of the connection between the myocytes but also on the
direction of propagation with respect to the cardiac fiber
orientation. Nevertheless, as presented in Figure 9, the range
of values for percolation threshold, a pure topological or
anatomical metric, is still very important. Even in the case of
tissue anisotropy, this range of values for percolation thresh-
old (0.47–0.52) marked the percentage of fibrotic tissue, 𝜙,
needed for a tissue to have a high probability to generate
reentry and become an ectopic pacemaker.

In addition, similar to Figure 9, Figures 14 and 15 present
how the conduction velocity (CV) depends on 𝜙 for the case
of LP and TP propagation directions, respectively.The figures
present the results of average and STD of the calculated
values of CV. We can observe the existence of extremely slow
propagating waves for 𝜙 near the percolation threshold.

4.3. A New Discrete Model for Cardiac Tissue. We developed
and tested a new discrete model which is a reduced and
simplified version of a complexmicroscopicmodel. To obtain
the same physiological conditions, we carefully tuned the
parameters of the connectivities. As a result of the fitting,

traveling and spiral waves propagate with very similar pattern
and velocities in both models, discrete and microscopic,
under homogeneous conditions; that is, we have observed
a quantitative match of the two models. Therefore, we can
conclude that the new developed discrete model is a good
alternative for the microscopic one under homogeneous
conditions, since it offers simulations that are much faster, in
terms of execution times, than those using the microscopic
model.

We have also compared the microscopic and the discrete
models under heterogeneous conditions. Both models have
shown the same qualitative behavior when the probability of
reentry was studied on fibrotic tissues. However, quantitative
differences were also clearly present. Out of the 60 simula-
tions that we have chosen to compare the two models, in 49
the two models matched (in terms of reentry generation),
that is, 82% of agreement. However, within the cases where
reentries were observed using the discrete model, 30 cases,
only 19 also generated reentry when using the microscopic
model, which drops the matches to 63%.

Therefore, our preliminary results suggest that the dis-
cretemodel overestimates the probability of reentry, if we take
the microscopic model as our gold standard. We have taken
a close look at the simulations where the two models did not
match. Figure 16 presents an example of these comparisons.
In panels (a), (b), and (c), we observe a successful reentry
propagation (from right to left in the tissue) using the
discrete model. In panels (d), (e), and (f), we observe the
corresponding situation using the microscopic model, where
reentry dies out. Comparing panels (a) and (d) we observe
that current spreads outmore easily in themicroscopicmodel
(panel (d)) than in the discrete model (panel (a)). This is
due to the continuous nature of the microscopic model. As
a result, current sink is larger in the microscopic model than
in the discrete model. This classical source-sink mismatch
[46] blocks the propagation of the reentry in the microscopic
model. On the other hand, the lumped nature of the discrete
model seems to help propagation by reducing the sink area.

Nevertheless, we reinforce that, even in these cases of
microfibrosis simulation, we can claim that the results of the
discretemodelmatched qualitatively those of themicroscopic
model, with accuracy between 60% and 80%. Since this study
involved the simulations of more than three thousands of

different fibrotic tissues, we note that these statistics would
not be possible to generate in a timely fashion without the aid
of the new discrete model.

4.4. Limitations and Future Work. All the simulations shown
in this study were carried out in a completely damaged area.
Fibrosis is typically localized in the heart and the damaged
area coexists with healthy surrounding. In [24], two different
simulations were performed: one considered a completely
damaged area, that is, a fibrotic region as performed here
in this work, and another larger setup considered a fibrotic
region surrounded by healthy tissue. In [24] it was shown
that most of the reentries generated inside the fibrotic region,
but not all of them, could propagate to the healthy tissue.
In future studies we will use the same methods presented
here to simulate the setup of a fibrotic region surrounded by
healthy tissue and quantify, as performed here, how features
of fibrosis are related to the generation of ectopic pacemakers.

We have fixed the size of the simulation area to 1 ×
1 cm2. However, the probability to find an ectopic beat is
proportional to the probability to have locally the adequate
conditions for a source-link mismatch [46]. Such probability
depends on the size of the system, the larger the system, the
higher the probability to obtain an ectopic beat. In future
studies on a systematic variation of the domain of integration
will help to identify a minimum size for the generation of
reentry.

Two different dynamics have been previously obtained
in [24], sustained and nonsustained reentries. The last case
produce a single ectopic beat without any repetition and

with a mild effect in the cardiac muscle. The first one is
associates with ectopic pacemakers. In this work, we did
not quantitatively differentiate between sustained and non-
sustained reentries. In future works, longer simulations will
be performed to better classify how many of the simulated
reentries are sustained and how many are not.

We have employed the Bondarenkomodel [35] formouse
ventricle. A natural next step in terms of translational science
is to replace this model with a human atrial or ventricular
model. In addition, other important electrophysiological
changes should be taken into account by the models in
order to simulate fibrosis. In future works, a more complete
description of fibrosis may include, for example, gap junction
remodeling as well as myocyte-fibroblast coupling [47].

Finally, we want to note that we considered two dimen-
sional slabs of tissue. It is usually a strong simplification of
the geometry of the tissue. In the near future we will consider
three-dimensional simulations. In this case, the introduction
of an additional dimension will probably change the topolog-
ical conditions of the grid (percolation threshold will change
from 0.5% to larger values) but not the phenomenology
around the percolation threshold as it was anticipated in [24].

5. Conclusions

We developed and tested a new discrete model which is
a reduced and simplified version of a detailed subcellular
microscopic model that accounts for the microstructure of
the cardiac tissue including distribution of cells and gap

junctions. Our preliminary results suggest a very good agree-
ment between the simulations of the new discrete model and
those obtained by the detailed and subcellular microscopic
model. The new discrete model was used for the simulation
of fibrotic regions. Our results quantitatively described how
the percentage of fibrosis (𝜙) influences the probability of
a region to become an ectopic pacemaker. Reentry activity
inside a fibrotic region was identified in cardiac tissues
with a percentage of fibrosis (or nonconducting material)
between 41% and 52%. In addition, our results suggest that
the probability of reentry inside a fibrotic region not only
depends on 𝜙 but also on the direction of propagation
with respect to the cardiac fiber orientation; that is, tissue
anisotropy also plays an important role.

In summary, our simulation results present the genera-
tion of reentry inside fibrotic tissues. Therefore, we were able
to generate an ectopic pacemaker in computer simulations of
cardiac electrophysiology by assuming a single microstruc-
tural or anatomical hypothesis for substrate: the existence
of a mixture of excitable and nonexcitable regions. The two
different phases (excitable and nonexcitable) form a maze
or labyrinth for wave propagation. Propagation becomes
fractioned and the topology of the maze allows the electric
wave to reexcite the fibrotic tissue before the wave leaves it.
Our results can be combined with previous works that used a
very similar computationalmodel to study CFAEs.Therefore,
we present a clear theoretical evidence that brings together
ectopic pacemakers and complex fractionated electrograms
for the case of propagation in fibrotic tissues thatmay become
triggers of fibrillation.
